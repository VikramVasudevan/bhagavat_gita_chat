These are external things only. conditions. No one can claim to be a sannyasi or yogi by these externals The inner impurities of the mind should be cleared, the attachment should be given up, and the desire for enjoyment should be relinquished. Inner purification comes first, and then only external renunciation. It is only then that one may rightly be recognised as a Sannyasi or Yogi.",

    "translation": "O Arjuna! That which is called sannyasa, know that to be yoga also; no one who has not given up desire can ever become a yogi.",
    "commentary": "By sharp discrimination between the Self and non-Self, the Jnanayogi rejects anatma (non-self) and establishes himself in the Supreme Reality. The Karma yogi acts without any feeling of doership, without desire, without the sense of ‘I’ and ‘Mine’, and surrenders his work with its fruits to God. So acting he lives in the Supreme Reality. The Jnana yogi follows the path of introspection into himself by eliminating the senses the mind and the external world. The Bhakti yogi has no relish for anything in the world, and he contemplates the Lord repeating His name, singing His glories, and thus lives in bliss and blessedness.In this way whatever path man may follow – Jnana, Karma, Bhakti, Dhyana – the inner principle is the same (i.e.) the rejection of insentient material things. Besides this, life in the Divine is implicit in all these yogas. That is why the Lord teaches that sannyasa and yoga are the same in their goal and aim.No one who has not renounced desire, the ego-centric initiative (samkalpa) for possessing material things, can ever become a yogi. Without the renunciation of desire, to live an idle and aimless life is neither sannyasa nor yoga.",

    "translation": "For the sage aspiring to ascend to yoga, action is said to be the means; and for the same sage enthroned in yoga serenity is called the means.",
    "commentary": "To achieve success in Jnanayoga or Dhyana yoga, action (Nishkamakarma) is said to be the means. When success is attained in yoga and the mind approaches steadiness in the Self, a quiescent state free from action (sama) is said to be the means for deeper union with the Self. Therefore in the early stages of meditation purity has to be acquired by the practice of Nishkama karma. Afterward, as the mind becomes firm and steady by its purity, action should be gradually reduced. It means that as the aspirant approaches the Self nearer and nearer, action drops off of its own accord, even as dry leaves fall from the tree. The field of activity is thus transferred from the external world to the inner realm of the human personality. Hearing of Atma, thinking of Atma, meditating on Atma (sravana, munana, nidhidhyasa) – the seeker is disinclined to come out of the inner pursuit to active functions of the outer world with the body and the senses. He finds supreme satisfaction in being absorbed in the Self. The turbulence of the bodily organs and the senses is quelled. The seeker has no use for them because the mind and the intellect are turned within and the ascent towards the Self is maintained steadily. Such quietude of the physical and mental mechanism will enable him ultimately to reach the state where there are no thought modifications, and the Self is directly realised.",

    "translation": "Let a man be lifted up by his own self; let him not lower himself; for he himself is his friend, and he himself is his enemy.",
    "commentary": "The Lord declares that each individual should lift himself up by his own effort. The Sastras and the Guru point the way. Each one has to tread the path himself. He has to see with his own eyes, walk with his own legs, and satisfy his hunger by feeding himself. Man is the architect of his own destiny, the pilot of his own fate. God helps those who help themselves. To think that God would take the people to the land of peace while they live a life of idleness and sensuality is utterly wrong. So also, no teacher however great he might be can take a person to freedom if he does not show grace to himself. They cannot give him a passport to immortality if he does not strive to purify himself and live the life of godliness. One has to pay the price even for a small article in the market. Thus we can imagine what price a man has to pay to obtain eternal joy and peace. Will idleness purchase this immortal blessing? How much effort, struggle, and striving is needed to attain freedom? So let each man work diligently by carrying out the instructions of the Sastras and the Guru. Finally, it is the self that realises the Self. The Lord makes it clear to all seekers that they should not expect any sudden transformation from one state to another by any sort of miracle or jugglery. It is a hard struggle from first to last. One should be prepared for it if he wants the highest reward of life.",

    "commentary": "The same idea as in the previousverseis elaborated here. Friend and foe are both inside man. The subdued mind is a friend, and the turbulent mind is the enemy.  External friends or enemies are not so loyal or persistent as the conquered mind. The mind subdued and kept under control is the greatest friend to lead one to eternal peace. Even so, the turbulent mind poisoned with lust and greed leads to destruction. So control of the mind is essential for spiritual progress.The word Atma in this context refers to the mind including the senses and the bodily organs.",

    "translation": "The man who has subdued the mind and is full of peace experiences the Supreme Self under all conditions in heat and cold, pleasure and pain, honour and dishonour. (The mind of such a man experiences the Self under all conditions).",
    "commentary": "The ill-regulated mind of the common man is upset by the pains of opposites, heat and cold, pleasure and pain, honour and disgrace. Proud in the hour of praise, sullen in the hour of shame, elated in the hour of pleasure, depressed in the hour of pain, the mind goes through a constant wheel of different moods and passions. Every moment of life causes a peculiar change in mind. The ignorant man lives and dies under the sway of the turbulent and disturbed mind. He is never peaceful. Peace is the result of a restful state of mind. When the mind is in a state of restless ecstasy, there can be no taste of peace at all. But the mind of the sage is different. It is always in a state of balance, whatever changes may be happening outside, and rests in the infinite peace of Atma. As little waves and ripples of wind cannot shake a huge mountain, the pairs of opposites cannot move the man who has subdued the mind. He is always established in the Self and enjoys the bliss of Self. So by constant practice, the seeker has to keep the mind in a condition of immovable stability.",

Unless the body is light and strong, meditation is difficult to practise. So, regulation of food and sleep is prescribed as the first condition of yoga. Generally, people think that spirituality is something not connected with the body and what they eat and how they work does not matter. It is not so. The body if not regulated is itself the chief obstacle to spiritual realisation. A sickly body subject to pain binds the mind to itself and its suffering and does not allow it to rise to the plane of thought and meditation. We know that when the body is healthy and strong, the mind becomes free from the bondage of the body and becomes capable of higher thought and imagination. Regulation of the body is therefore emphasised many times in the Gita.",

    "transliteration": "yuktāhāra-vihārasya yukta-cheṣhṭasya karmasuyukta-svapnāvabodhasya yogo bhavati duḥkha-hā",
    "word_by_word_meaning": "yukta—moderate; āhāra—eating; vihārasya—recreation; yukta cheṣhṭasya karmasu—balanced in work; yukta—regulated; svapna-avabodhasya—sleep and wakefulness; yogaḥ—Yog; bhavati—becomes; duḥkha-hā—the slayer of sorrows",
    "translation": "For him who is moderate in food and recreation, moderate in exertion in all actions, moderate in sleep and wakefulness, yoga destroys all pain and suffering (caused by birth and death).",
    "commentary": "“Be moderate, avoid excess in all things” – This is the Lord’s command. Yoga then destroys all suffering. So if a man suffers, the cause for it is excessive indulgence in some form or other.Self-control actually means the power by which man can order the body and mind to function according to the highest spiritual laws.There is no self-control for the man whose body and mind act in their own way in defiance of the spiritual laws. This principle holds good in Dhyanayoga. Enthusiastic beginners, with more zeal than wisdom, overdo the sadhana and consequently suffer discomfort and pain, and then they give up the practice altogether thinking that they are not fit for it.Overdoing a good thing is as harmful as indulgence in bad things.Young students burn midnight oil to prepare for the examinations, and in writing the examination, they become exhausted and their whole work goes in vain. Even if they pass the examination, the after-effects of over-exertion cause some disease or other. So also in spiritual Sadhana the progress should be slow, steady, and sure. Over-exertion defeats the very purpose of yoga. Ascetic torture of the body by fasting too much and sleeplessness is not the way of yoga. A moderate way of life is yoga. The golden mean is yoga. Harmony and balance is yoga. It shows that a man can practice yoga while engaged in all the activities of life by strictly adhering to the law of moderation. In fact the body itself is made and sustained on the principle of harmony, balance and moderation. Excess of heat burns it, excess of cold stiffens it. The eyes cannot see when there is an excess light; in total darkness also they; cannot see. Extremes are alike. Moderate light and warmth are necessary for the proper functioning of the body. The analogy may be extended to the realm of the mind also. Excess of study dulls the brain, and causes fatigue and nervous disorders. Excess of emotion causes insanity. The nervous system breaks down by agitation and mental conflict. So moderation and harmony are the very principles of man’s existence. It is the law of nature. Yoga (Dhyanayoga) is possible only for the man who avoids excess in all activities of life. The yogi transcends all suffering by yoga.",

The same process is stated in Vedanta in different terminology (1) Vasanakshaya, (2) Manonasa, and (3) Tattvajnana. One is actioned by the others (i.e.) by the elimination of all desires mind ceases to exist, and the Atmajnana is realised. When Atmajnana dawns the mind with all its propensity for material enjoyment is destroyed.",

The windows of the senses through which the objective world gets into the mind causing destruction are closed by perfect self-control, and so the mind remains steady and firm in meditation.

It comes and goes. The joy of Atma alone is beyond time and place and is not affected by any change of circumstances. The wise man naturally seeks the best and the highest. The Yogi who is tranquil in mind, in whom Rajasic tendencies like Kama and Krodha are brought to rest, who is free from evil, enjoys supreme joy.

He should speak only that which he knows, and practise that which he speaks. So should religious spirit permeate all the words and actions of its votaries. Otherwise, their words are of no use. It is the divergence between theory and practice that brings disrepute to a person. The man who speaks religion should be exemplary in his conduct. When it is accepted that Atma is the reality in all beings, what should be the practical conduct of the yogi? How should he think, feel and act? He should intimately feel that the joys and sorrows of all beings are just the same as his own. The pangs of hunger and the bereavement of other people are of the same nature as his own. He understands the sufferings of others not only of men but of animals and other beings in the same spirit as his own suffering. He shares the gladness of others, and he suffers the pains of others. Such universality of feeling distinguishes the yogi of the highest perfection. This is religion brought into the field of practical action.",

Evidently, Arjuna is conscious of his own inadequate power of concentration on reality. Every common human being is in the same position as Arjuna. So his question is the question of all human beings with very rare exceptions. As it is said already, Arjuna stands as a representative of the common man, though of higher culture, in his search for truth. Unsteadiness of mind is the basic problem for all seekers. If the mind is brought to a state of firmness, any yoga is practicable. Otherwise, nothing is possible. Arjuna opens his mind to the Lord and confesses his weakness without reservation. So should the disciple place before the Guru his difficulties frankly. The sick man should explain his bodily condition without reservation to the doctor. Even those secrets which he would not reveal to others should be explained to the physician. Only then can the physician prescribe the correct medicine.",

The body and senses are harassed continuously by its restlessness.Peace is practically impossible when the heart is churned by the mind like the milky ocean by the Mandara mountain.Having fed and strengthened itself on worldly things for several births, it has acquired great power and defies all attempts to bring it under control. The nature of the mind is described here by four attributes. It is restless, turbulent, strong and unyielding. Every man knows the vagaries of the mind. The elders compare it to a monkey, drunk and stung by a scorpion. Those who practice meditation know how the mind rebels and defies discipline. Arjuna compares it to the wind.",

    "commentary": "The Lord accepts here that the task of restraining the mind is very difficult because of its restless nature. But there is no need to despair. It can be controlled by practice and dispassion. The great teachers point out that there are ways and means of overcoming the difficulties in the control of the mind. The Lord while admitting the mind’s restlessness, encourages Arjuna that there is a way to control it, and the way is practice and dispassion. One need not fear the strength of an enemy, provided he arms himself with a mightier weapon. What if the elephant is strong, it is enough if one holds the iron rod. Lions and tigers are strong, but what of it? A powerful gun is enough to overpower them. Thus the Lord wants his disciple not to become panicky and submit to the tyranny of the mind. Though difficult, it is not impossible. Is it not difficult to conquer Mount Everest? And yet man has set his foot on the snowy peak. Is it not difficult to land on the moon? And yet man stepped on the moon. The achievements of man prove that things difficult are not things impossible of attainment. So the nature of the mind, be it what it is, is not impossible to overcome.",

Only the sage of controlled mind can attain the Supreme Being.Whoever desires the highest should control the mind by every means available to him according to his mental predisposition.The mind should let go the fatal embrace in which man is held by the objective world. The bonds should be loosened. Whether it is by discrimination or devotion, by study of the sastras, by the teaching of the Guru, by personal experience, by observation of other people’s lives, in some way or other, the mind should detach itself from the kind of bondage to the external world. Only then, will it be able to turn inwards to look into its own source, the Atma, and yoga becomes possible.",

He presents the case of an aspirant who has faith in the Guru’s teaching, who is practising self-control, but who passes away before perfection is gained in yoga. What will happen to that man? Where does he go? Has he any future, or should he start everything afresh? Will all his struggle and effort go to waste? This is a very natural doubt, for, most aspirants have a deep-seated doubt that they may not be able to attain perfection in this life. Very rarely do we come across the intense type of yogi who is determined to get the highest even in this life.

People may doubt whether any good comes to them by being and doing good. In fact, to the ignorant, the world presents the curious spectacle of bad people enjoying more material comforts than the good and the righteous. But a closer look into the facts of life shows that the wicked and the evil-minded are daily undergoing destruction in their own heart of hearts, and they shall be hurled into lower and lower planes of existence. The good live and thrive in the sun-shine of God’s grace, though material riches they may not possess.

They go to the worlds of the good, live there for many years, and then take birth in a pure and prosperous home. They take up the thread of sadhana that was snapped by death in the middle. They enjoy life in the highest worlds, and when they come to the earth again, they are prosperous. Let it not be misunderstood that they revel in gold and destroy themselves by abusing their wealth. The Lord states ‘Suchinam‘ (of the pure) first, and next ‘Srimatam‘ (of the wealthy). Purity first and prosperity next. They do not suffer the pains of poverty and at the same time, their home is full of sanctity and purity. Such a spiritual home, free from the torments of poverty, is most congenial for sadhana. If he is poor he has to fritter away part of his life and energy for seeking out his livelihood. If he is wealthy, he may lose himself in material pleasures. Pure and prosperous homes provide the best training ground for spiritual practice. If however, one is asked to choose between the two, he has to choose the pure in preference to the wealthy.",

Though the body is dead and gone, yet the mind, with all the impressions acquired in previous births, live on, and when the Jiva takes another body, the former mental endowment comes to him. So he continues the sadhana exactly from the point where it came to an end when the body fell. Nothing is lost in death except the fleshy tabernacle. There is a continuity from birth to birth, and the chain continues till the moment when liberation is attained, and the mind with all its samskaras is destroyed. This view of rebirth is the only possible explanation for the disparity in the mental make-up of different individuals as we see them. The good thoughts, feelings, and actions of the past create a natural propensity for good things in this life. Even so, the bad thoughts and deeds done in the past produce a natural inclination to evil in this life. So, it is a warning to all to be careful of what force they are generating at the present moment. They should realise that they are accumulating samskaras and giving a special direction to their future life by their thoughts and actions at the present moment. Let no one complain that he is bad because society or circumstances made him bad. He has himself created the bad in and around him, and he should shoulder full responsibility for what he is in the present birth. He is the maker of his own destiny. He reaps what he sows.",

Past thoughts and habits of life, whatever they may be, fulfill themselves in the present birth. We come across persons who are born with vairagya, whom no temptations can draw down into the mire of samsara. Just so, we find persons steeped in samsara in spite of all the disasters and calamities of life. So, past yogic practice drives him who are born to take to yoga without his being aware of any special effort on his part. He cannot remain idle.
