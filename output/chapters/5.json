But in the process of development, the Yoga of desireless action is superior to the renunciation of action.Karmayoga is better than Karmasannyasayoga. Arjuna has not yet attained the Self-state, devoid of the phenomenal universe. Millions of people live, move, and have their being in the objective world. It is not proper to teach them renunciation of action in the very beginning because they would not understand the true meaning of that doctrine. And, if a man without ripeness of Knowledge renounces action, he becomes a lost soul here and hereafter. The common man should act, work, carry out the injunctions of the Sastras, and do everything demanded of him as a duty in the course of his daily life. Such selfless devotion to duty will gradually purify the mind of all itslatent tendencies, and then man becomes fit to enter the Self-state, where there is no actor, no action and nothing to act.",

    "translation": "Children, not the wise, say that Jnana yoga and karma yoga are distinct: He who is truly established in either of them obtains the fruit of both.",
    "commentary": "The Pandit mentioned here is the sage who knows the Truth and lives in it, and not a man of mere theoretical knowledge of the Sastras and the scriptures. Only the ignorant say that karma yoga and jnana yoga are distinct and separate.The Lord makes the categorical declaration that the fruit of both the yogas is the same and that the Sadhaka who takes to one of them and is well established in it, will attain the highest fruit of both. Direct perception of Atma is the aim of all yogas.Some highly evolved men follow Jnana marga. They carry on the inquiry into the real nature of things and separate the Drik (the Seer) from the Drisya (the phenomenal world) as the mythical swan is able to separate milk and water. Thus they realise Atma through Jnana marga. Others, according to their natural tendencies, take to Karma marga, and through desireless action and surrender of the fruits to the Lord, reach the same goal ofAtma-sakshatkaraby their purified minds. The reward of freedom, liberation, is the same for both, only the paths differ. So, in both, the seeker aims at the absorption of the ego into the Self, and thereby transcends the feeling of personal doership. When the Jiva-idea is given up, what remains is only Sivatvam and nothing else. So the Lord exhorts the aspirant to take up either of the two yogas and practice it well.",

    "commentary": "The Lord reiterates the unity of Jnanayoga and Karmayoga in regard to the ultimate goal. The wise man sees the truth behind each sadhana and knows that though they are outwardly different, they are leading to the same consummation. It is only the ignorant who imagine that one path is superior to the other. These paths are intended to serve the needs of different aspirants born with different tendencies, and previous samskaras.One can reach any part of the globe by going east or west. Similarly one can reach the spiritual goal by anyway. The harmonisation of different systems and creeds is the purpose of the Gita. At every step, the teacher of the Gita insists on the fact that the goal is the same, and explains the different paths from that standpoint. Hence the Gita is universal in its appeal to all mankind.",

    "commentary": "It is stated here that without the aid of Karma Yoga final renunciation and the realisation of Self is not possible. That is, perfection in Karma Yoga – doing work without desire and attachment, surrendering the fruits to the Lord – is absolutely necessary to rise to the plane of pure Knowledge. Certainly, it is not an easy task to remain established in Brahman, without outward pulls and pressures of the objective world. All the bad samskaras have to be overcome, and they cannot be overcome except by righteous action and desireless performance of good work. Karma yoga is therefore the elementary course, and jnana yoga is the higher course. Unless the foundation of karma yoga is strongly laid, the superstructure of jnana cannot stand for a minute. How can anyone hope to remain fixed in the Atmic state when the mind is impure and drawn to the objective world in a hundred ways? Let the mind be purified first. Hence the Lord insists on Karmayoga for all seekers. Out of compassion, the Lord explains the natural sequence and graded progress of spiritual laws.",

    "commentary": "The attitude of the man of perfect Knowledge is explained here. Atma is the witness of all phenomena. Just as the sun is only a witness to the various human actions that take place in the light that he sheds, just as the lamp is only a witness of the actions taking place in its light, Atma is just a witness of the activities of the body, the senses, and the mind, which take place by His all-pervading life-force.

It seems that the perfect yogi makes the instruments of action work in their proper fields, even as a mechanic makes the machine work. By such work, the mind becomes absolutely pure and liberation is thereby attained. The liberated yogi continues to work so long as the vehicle of the body (upadhi) remains, but all that he does is only for the sake of others, for the benefit of mankind.

Nature carries on the whole of this universal drama according to its own laws. By the power of Prakriti man has attached himself to actions, and thinks that he is acting, enjoying suffering, and that he is the doer. In fact, it is not the real man that is the doer. The personal agent is a spurious idea created by the power of Maya. Having thus forgotten his real nature, man has created for himself a wilderness of likes and dislikes, good and bad-evil desires, and those samskaras go on functioning in their own way through the variegated phenomena of life. To know this secret is Knowledge.When a man does evil, it is not the real Self that does evil, but man’s nature. When a man does good, it is not the real Self that does good, but man’s nature. So, the evil accumulated in one’s nature should be counteracted by the good, and then one should rise above both good and evil in the realisation of Atma. The seeker need not be disheartened by the evil in him. It is his own making, and what he has done, he can undo also. Effort is needed in that direction for self-purification. This struggle is the natural order of life. The Lord has nothing to do with it. Man has to attain purification by his own effort. The Lord here states that personal agency, actions and their results are all conducted by the power of Prakriti.",

He should think of that at all times, he should merge himself in That, he should be firmly rooted in That, and he should have no other thing except That as the sole refuge and aim. Such a man alone can realise Brahman.It is a psychological truth that man becomes That which he contemplates. By ignorance, man is contemplating samsara, and so he is bound by it by the effect of his own absorption in it. Now the sadhana should be made in the opposite direction. Mind should contemplate the Supreme Reality, the freedom of the self, and if this is done constantly till the whole personality is filled with that, then the Atma becomes manifest as the Reality in man.It is true that the mind cannot all of a sudden become absorbed in That. The mind oscillates between the objective world on the one side, and Atma on the other. But constant, unremitting and intense practice will fix the direction of the mind towards Atma. All great men have gone through this practice. They have concentrated all their energies in Atma, and dedicated their whole being to That. And thus they have realised the Supreme.",

In all the varied manifestations of nature, they see the underlying substratum (i.e) Atma, and so they do not make any distinction between one thing and another. For them, all that exists, whatever the name and form may be, is made of one substance – Brahman (Atma). So they have love and compassion for all the creatures without distinction of high or low, caste and creed, and so on. The Brahmana here stands for the highest purity. The outcaste (svapaka) represents the lowest order of human beings. The sage looks upon both with an equal eye, because the background for the highest spiritual giant and the meanest wretch is Brahman and nothing else. Is the vision of the sage confined to humans only? No. His vision embraces all the created beings. So the elephants, dogs the cows are mentioned to represent the animal kingdom. It means animals, birds, reptiles and all living creatures without any exception at all, are included in the universal vision of the sage. All are Brahman. One who looks upon all these equally is the man of real Knowledge.",
