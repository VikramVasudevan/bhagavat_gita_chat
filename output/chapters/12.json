      "evam:(‘thus’): This word refers to the last verse(matkarmakrit etc.)in the previous Discourse.",
      "Arjuna’s question is simple and clear. Who are superior – those who worship the Divine form, as the Cosmic Manifestation, or the four-armed Vishnu, or the cowherd boy of Brindavan(sagunopasaka)– or those who meditate on the formless, attributeless Brahman(nirgunopasaka)?In the 2nd Discourse the Lord has declared the deathless and birthless reality of Atma, and in the 8th Discourse, he has explained the Nirguna aspect as Imperishable Brahman. It is quite natural for Arjuna to question the Lord about the superior excellence of either of the two. Arjuna’s question is the question of all seekers in the world – which is the better method of worship – Saguna or Nirguna?",
      "The next Sunday we left for Dakshineswar early in the morning. During that day’s visit I said to Sri Ramakrishna:“Some people say that God is formless; others say He has form; and still others call Him Krishna, Shiva, or Kali. Could you tell us what the real nature of God is?”",
      "Sri Ramakrishna smiled and said: “He is sometimes with form; He is sometimes formless; and again He is beyond both. He is all-pervading. It is difficult to ascertain His real nature. Just as there is nothing to compare gold with except gold, so there is nothing equal to God. He is the cause of the gross objects as well as of the subtle mind and intellect. For example: The same substance in its solid form is ice; in its liquid form is water; and in its gaseous form is vapour. God manifests Himself according to the mental attitude of the spiritual aspirant. A jnani experiences God as all-pervading, formless space, and a devotee perceives God with a particular form. So if you sincerely want to know the real nature of God, meditate on Him in solitude. Have patience. Surrender yourself to Him and pray. When the right time comes you will see Him.”",
      "I then said, “We enjoy peace when we feel the presence of God in our hearts; otherwise mere intellectual understanding of God and atheism are the same.”",
      "Sri Ramakrishna then replied: “In the beginning one should move forward on the spiritual path holding to an initial faith [i.e., faith in the words of the scriptures and the guru]. One then attains direct perception. There are two kinds of faith — initial faith and real faith [i.e., faith that comes from direct experience]. Be steadfast in the first one and then you will see God.”",

Whether he is a Saguna or Nirguna worshipper or whether he is a sannyasi or house-holder-these distinctions have no significance at all.

      "“Dive deep; one does not get the precious gems by merely floating on the surface. God is without form, no doubt; but He also has form. By meditating on God with form one speedily acquires devotion; then one can meditate on the formless God. It is like throwing a letter away, after learning its contents, and then setting out to follow its instructions.” (Source:Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna)",
      "—–",
      "The Master said to the kathak: “The gopis had ecstatic love, unswerving and single-minded devotion to one ideal. Do you know the meaning of devotion that is not loyal to one ideal? It is devotion tinged with intellectual knowledge. It makes one feel: ‘Krishna has become all these. He alone is the Supreme Brahman. He is Rama, Siva, and Sakti.’ But this element of knowledge is not present in ecstatic love of God. Once Hanuman came to Dwaraka and wanted to see Sita and Rama. Krishna said to Rukmini, His queen, ‘You had better assume the form of Sita; otherwise there will be no escape from the hands of Hanuman.'(Because Rama and Sita were Hanuman’s Chosen Ideals.) “Once the Pandava brothers performed the Rajasuya sacrifice. All the kings placed Yudhisthira on the royal throne and bowed low before him in homage. But Bibhishana, the King of Ceylon, said, ‘I bow down to Narayana and to none else.’ At these words the Lord Krishna bowed down to Yudhisthira. Only then did Bibhishana prostrate himself, crown and all, before him.“Do you know what devotion to one ideal is like? It is like the attitude of a daughter-in-law in the family. She serves all the members of the family — her brothers-in-law, father-in-law, husband, and so forth —, bringing them water to wash their feet, fetching their towels, arranging their seats, and the like; but with her husband she has a special relationship.",
      "“There are two elements in this ecstatic love: ‘I-ness’ and ‘my-ness’. Yasoda used to think: ‘Who would look after Gopala if I did not? He will fall ill if I do not serve Him.’ She did not look on Krishna as God. The other element is ‘my-ness’. It means to look on God as one’s own —’myGopala’. Uddhava said to Yasoda: ‘Mother, your Krishna is God Himself. He is the Lord of the Universe and not a common human being.’ ‘Oh!’ exclaimed Yasoda. ‘I am not asking you about your Lord of the Universe. I want to know howmyGopala fares. Not the Lord of the Universe, butmyGopala.’“How faithful to Krishna the gopis were! After many entreaties to the door-keeper, the gopis entered the royal court in Mathura, where Krishna was seated as king. The door-keeper took them to Him; but at the sight of King Krishna wearing the royal turban, the gopis bent down their heads and said among themselves: ‘Who is this man with a turban on his head? Should we violate our chaste love for Krishna by talking to him? Where is our beloved Krishna with the yellow robe and the bewitching crest with the peacock feather?’“Did you observe the single-minded love of the gopis for Krishna? The ideal of Vrindavan is unique. I am told that the people of Dwaraka worship Krishna, the companion of Arjuna, but reject Radha.”A DEVOTEE: “Which is the better, ecstatic love or love mixed with knowledge?”",
      "MASTER:“It is not possible to develop ecstatic love of God unless you love Him very deeply and regard Him as your very own.“Listen to a story. Once three friends were going through a forest, when a tiger suddenly appeared before them. ‘Brothers,’ one of them exclaimed, ‘we are lost!’ ‘Why should you say that?’ said the second friend. ‘Why should we be lost? Come, let us pray to God.’ The third friend said: ‘No. Why should we trouble God about it? Come, let us climb this tree.’“The friend who said, ‘We are lost!’ did not know that there is a God who is our Protector. The friend who asked the others to pray to God was a jnani. He was aware that God is the Creator, Preserver, and Destroyer of the world. The third friend, who didn’t want to trouble God with prayers and suggested climbing the tree, had ecstatic love of God. It is the very nature of such love that it makes a man think himself stronger than his Beloved. He is always alert lest his Beloved should suffer. The one desire of his life is to keep his Beloved from even being pricked in the foot by a thorn.” (Source:Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna)"

    "commentary": [
      "One Paramatma is both with form and without form (Saguna and Nirguna), and so the goal of both forms of worship is the same. Whatever may be the method of worship, if it is practised with faith and devotion, man reaches Paramatma. These two verses deal with persons who seek Nirguna Para Brahmam. This first verse states the attributes of the Imperishable Brahman and the second the qualities necessary for the aspirant for such realisation. Even though the seeker carries on his meditation on the formless Brahman, yet, if he does not possess purity of mind, self-restraint, equanimity, and love for all beings, his effort does not yield the desired results. Without these qualities of good character, realisation of Brahman is impossible. His worship will be like depositing good and relishing eatables in an impure vessel. All of them become corrupt and contaminated by the impurities of the vessel. Both the paths of realisation require the above qualities of character. Therefore the Lord mentions the three indispensable qualities of the aspirant in this context.",
      "The seekers should cultivate these three qualities well while carrying on their method of worship. Here the word‘Samniyamya’is used to emphasise complete control of all the senses; the word‘Sarvatra’emphasises equanimity at all times and under all circumstances, and‘Sarvabhutahiteratah’emphasises love for all beings without any distinction whatsoever. Thus meditating, the seeker attains the Lord undoubtedly. Let all the seekers examine themselves how far they have acquired these basic virtues.",
      "Keshab began to serve some puffed rice and grated coconut. The guests held these in the folds of their wearing-cloths and presently started to eat. Everyone was joyful.The Master noticed, however, that Keshab and Vijay rather shrank from each other, and he was anxious to reconcile them.",
      "MASTER (to Keshab):“Look here. There is Vijay. Your quarrel seems like the fight between Siva and Rama. Siva was Rama’s guru. Though they fought with each other, yet they soon came to terms. But the grimaces of the ghosts, the followers of Siva, and the gibberish of the monkeys, the followers of Rama, would not come to an end! (Loud laughter.) Such quarrels take place even among one’s own kith and kin. Didn’t Rama fight with His own sons, Lava and Kusa? Again, you must have noticed how a mother and daughter, living together and having the same spiritual end in view, observe their religious fast separately on Tuesdays, each on her own account — as if the welfare of the mother were different from the welfare of the daughter. But what benefits the one benefits the other. In like manner, you have a religious society, and Vijay thinks he must have one too. (Laughter.) But I think all these are necessary. While Sri Krishna, Himself God Incarnate, played with the gopis at Vrindavan, trouble-makers like Jatila and Kutila appeared on the scene. You may ask why. The answer is that the play does not develop without trouble-makers. (All laugh.) There is no fun without Jatila and Kutila. (Loud laughter.)“Ramanuja upheld the doctrine of Qualified Non-dualism. But his guru was a pure non-dualist.They disagreed with each other and refuted each other’s arguments. That always happens. Still, to the teacher the disciple is his own.”All rejoiced in the Master’s company and his words.",

    "commentary": [
      "It is here declared that for those who are body-minded, the worship of Nirguna Brahman is very difficult. For others it is easy. That is, for the aspirant who is more self-controlled, who has acquired facility in desireless action, the contemplation of Brahman is quite suitable and comfortable. So it should be clearly understood that the difficulty here is only for those who have not acquired purity by worshipping Isvara (God). It should also be remembered that in the previous two verses, the Lord has declared that the goal of both paths is the same, and both require certain qualities without which no spiritual growth is possible.",
      "Therefore let the seekers be not in a hurry to reach the unmanifest even at the start. Let them try to get over the body-attached egoism by the worship of Isvara, and obtain complete mastery of their senses through the desireless performance of all good actions. Then self-realisation becomes possible and man attains union with Brahman easily. Most people complain that their ‘sadhana’ is not bearing fruit. It is because their minds are not purified. Of what use is it to sow the seeds before preparing the ground? Will any building stand without a proper foundation? So, the mind does not come to rest in Brahman when it is impure by past ‘samskaras’. The aspirant should understand the position correctly so that he might not feel frustrated by failing to get the proper results immediately.",
      "In truth, worship and meditation are realms of bliss and blessedness. One is entering the ocean of Sachidananda! Why the pain and difficulty? It is intended to remove suffering and not to cause it. But people find it difficult and painful because they do not know the path clearly and distinctly. So for some time in the beginning let the seekers carry on the worship of Isvara(Saguna)and then enter the path of meditation on the imperishable Brahman(Nirguna).",
      "Here [comes] the philosopher to show us the way out, to teach us what we really are. You may reason it out and understand it intellectually, but there is a long way between intellectual understanding and the practical realization of it. Between the plan of the building and the building itself there is quite a long distance. Therefore there must be various methods [to reach the goal of religion]. In the last course, we have been studying the method of philosophy, trying to bring everything under control, once more asserting the freedom of the soul. “It is very difficult. This way is not for [every]body. The embodied mind tries it with great trouble.”[Source]",

Returning home at nightfall, they took a light supper of fruit and roots.",
      "“But an aspirant cannot succeed in this form of spiritual discipline if his mind is stained with worldliness even in the slightest degree. The mind must withdraw totally from all objects of form, taste, smell, touch, and sound. Only thus does it become pure. The Pure Mind is the same as the Pure Atman. But such a mind must be altogether free from ‘woman and gold’. When it becomes pure, one has another experience. One realizes: ‘God alone is the Doer, and I am His instrument.’ One does not feel oneself to be absolutely necessary to others either in their misery or in their happiness.",

      "‘The path of Brahman is very difficult. Pray to the Master(Sri Ramakrishna) and he will give you the knowledge of Brahman in proper time.’",
      "— Sri Sarada Devi (Source:Teachings of Sri Sarada Devi by Swami Vireswarananda)",
      "Knowledge of Brahman and such things is not for ordinary people. For them the Lord’s words : “To those whose minds are set on Me, verily I become ere long, O son of Prithâ, the saviour out of the ocean of the mortal Samsâra (world)”; for “the goal of the Unmanifested is very hard for the embodied to reach.” The knowledge of Brahman is difficult for him who has not got over the consciousness of mind and body. But then, because the knowledge of Brahman is beyond the reach of such, it is not that they should become hopeless. In this connection an incident in the life of Shri Ramakrishna flashes before my mind. One day I had been to Dakshineswar. There were many others also. One of them was a great Pundit. Shri Ramakrishna asked him to explain Vedânta. For more than an hour he explained Vedanta to the great satisfaction of Shri Ramakrishna and everybody else. But then, Shri Ramakrishna said after this, “Well, all these things, however, do not appeal to me. Your philosophising—knowledge, knower, and known, etc.—all this is good no doubt. But what I like is, ‘I and my Mother alone exist and there is nothing else’.” These few words he expressed with such great feeling that everyone present felt it for the time being. All the conclusions of Vedanta seemed to pale before this idea. The Master’s idea seemed to be so easy to comprehend.",
      "The main thing is, you have to keep your mind fixed on God, whatever be the means. If that can be done, then our lives are blessed and won’t be spent uselessly. Eating, drinking, etc. we shall have so long as the body lasts. But Râmprasâd, the devotee of Kâli, says, “O my mind, worship Kâli, repeat day and night the Mantra given by your Guru. In lying down think you are prostrating before the Mother, make sleep your meditation on the Mother, while eating think you are offering to Mother Shyâmâ; all sounds that enter your ears are but Mantras of the Mother, for She, Kâli, is in all letters; going round the town, think you are circumambulating the Mother. Râmprasâd declares that Mother is in everything.” We have to follow the teachings of such great souls as these, and we are sure to have devotion for the Lord’s feet. Is what Râmprasâd says different from the knowledge of Brahman—seeing God in everything, everywhere, in every action, and in every being ? To work for the Lord, to know Him as the one object of our love, to love Him and give up all other attachments and to have no ill-feeling towards anyone—this is the easiest method to attain Him. Love, Love, that is what is required : if we have it for Him, then everything will be added unto us. It is not that we do not know what is love. We are habituated to love wife, children, friends, wealth, etc. This we have to direct towards God, for He is the one Reality in this world which is ever changing. Everything else in this world becomes after some time stale and even bitter. Love for Him alone is ever on the increase and ever new. With respect to other objects one gets disgusted after some time. That is why Prahlâda, the great devotee, says, “That deathless love which the ignorant have for the fleeting objects of the senses—as I keep meditating on Thee—may not that sort of intense love for Thee, slip away from my heart.” If one gets such love for Him there is no more delay for God-realisation—He even comes out of the pillar to manifest Himself to His devotee. Everything is a question of love. The more one loves Him, the more He manifests Himself in one’s heart. He is the friend of the sincere and pure. He is ever in our hearts, but we fail to see Him because our eyes are directed to other objects ; but for this there would have been no delay in realising Him. He is ever with us, we need not go to any place of pilgrimage in search of Him. If we but in all sincerity search Him for a moment, He comes to us. But who wants Him ? Ours is mere talk, we do not want Him from our hearts. Such is the power of Maya that we fail to see the Truth. So the Lord, out of His grace, has shown us the way out also. “Those who are absolutely resigned to Me, easily cross over this Maya of Mine.” “Surrender to Me”—there is no other way out. May the Lord out of His infinite grace hold our minds on to His feet—let this be our one prayer.",

    "commentary": [
      "In the first verse the path to be followed by the seeker and in the second, the highest reward of such ‘sadhana’ is mentioned. The path of ‘sadhana’ includes three things 1. Renouncing all actions to Him 2. Considering Him as the sole refuge and the highest goal, 3. Worshipping Him with an undivided mind. In this way, if man worships God, He becomes the Saviour and lifts him up from the ocean of samsara. What a wonderful reward for His worshippers! The Lord’s offer should inspire all human beings with joy and faith. They can derive consolation that they shall be freed from the fearful agonising tortures of worldly life. For the individual Jiva who is whirled about from birth to death and from death to birth again and again from time immemorial(Punarapi jananam punarapi maranam), these words of the Lord indeed have the potency of Nectar! What the life-boat is for the drowning man so is the Lord for unfortunate humanity. He would lift them up from this terrible ocean of ‘samsara’. But man should lift up his hand towards God, obtain His grace by devotion and self-surrender. For others who deny Him, who do not think of Him, there is no hope. The Lord is indifferent to them. They should have to wander about in the wilderness of ignorance and death. If man does what is expected of him, the Lord is ever by his side to help him. What can God do, if man refuses to accept Him and seek His help? Therefore the wise man, understanding his terrible fate in the wheel of ‘samsara,’ should strive in every way to obtain God’s grace. Nothing else can cure the disease of worldly life.",

      "Ananyenaiva yogena:After speaking of several yogas like Karma, Jnana and Dhyana etc. the Lord brings out another yoga-‘ananya yoga’. This is not a separate yoga, but no other yoga can yield proper fruit if it is not‘ananya yoga.’Single-mindedness and renunciation of all worldly thoughts and actions is the essence of this yoga. Then any yoga acquires tremendous power.",
      "Mam dhyayanta upasate: Here the word ‘dhyana’ is added to ‘upasana’. It is not simply worshiping without understanding, but worship combined with deep insight into the meaning and significance of the worship. When doing ‘Japa’, the sacred ‘mantra’ should not only be uttered but its meaning also should be contemplated. Similarly, when worshipping the Lord, His Divine Nature, Form and so should and qualities should be thought of deeply in a concentrated manner. Patanjali explains the same thing in his Yoga Sutras.",

      "Mrutyusamsara sagarat:Samsara’ is compared to an ocean. It is fearful like the ocean, infected with deadly dragons of desire and hatred (Kama and Krodha), never at rest and peace, always bubbling and boiling. Man is naturally terrified by it. And yet, some people think of the pleasures of ‘samsara’ wish for such fleeting joys. It is nothing but ignorance. They have yet to realise the foul and filthy nature of ‘samsara’, and the terrible end that comes to them through it. The Lord states it here – “Mrityusamsara”. Nothing can be a truer description of the wheel of birth and death and the horrible sorrow and suffering during the interval between the two. Man who is bound to this track should naturally seek God’s grace, the embodiment of bliss and blessedness.",
      "na chirat:Man is saved quickly (Gajendra, Prahlada. Ambarisha and Draupadi are examples).",
      "“Those who with constant attention always worship You, and those who worship the Undifferentiated, the Absolute, of these who are the greatest yogis?” — Arjuna asked of Shri Krishna. The answer was: “Those who concentrating their minds on Me worship Me with eternal constancy and are endowed with the highest faith, they are My best worshippers, they are the greatest yogis. Those that worship the Absolute, the Indescribable, the Undifferentiated, the Omnipresent, the Unthinkable, the All-comprehending, the Immovable, and the Eternal, by controlling the play of their organs and having the conviction of sameness in regard to all things, they also, being engaged in doing good to all beings, come to Me alone. But to those whose minds have been devoted to the unmanifested Absolute, the difficulty of the struggle along the way is much greater, for it is indeed with great difficulty that the path of the unmanifested Absolute is trodden by any embodied being. Those who, having offered up all their work unto Me, with entire reliance on Me, meditate on Me and worship Me without any attachment to anything else — them, I soon lift up from the ocean of ever-recurring births and deaths, as their mind is wholly attached to Me.”",
      "Jnana-yoga and bhakti-yoga are both referred to here. Both may be said to have been defined in the above passage. Jnana-yoga is grand; it is high philosophy; and almost every human being thinks, curiously enough, that he can surely do everything required of him by philosophy; but it is really very difficult to live truly the life of philosophy. We are often apt to run into great dangers in trying to guide our life by philosophy. This world may be said to be divided between persons of demoniacal nature who think the care-taking of the body to be the be-all and the end-all of existence, and persons of godly nature who realize that the body is simply a means to an end, an instrument intended for the culture of the soul. The devil can and indeed does cite the scriptures for his own purpose; and thus the way of knowledge appears to offer justification to what the bad man does, as much as it offers inducements to what the good man does. This is the great danger in jnana-yoga. But bhakti-yoga is natural, sweet, and gentle; the bhakta does not take such high flights as the jnana-yogi, and, therefore, he is not apt to have such big falls. Until the bondages of the soul pass away, it cannot of course be free, whatever may be the nature of the path that the religious man takes.[Source]",

      "The Lord is now teaching various practices to reach Him, one after another. The Lord is clear and simple in the teaching, like an able teacher when he is instructing a young boy. The first lesson is fixing the mind firmly in Him. It is not enough to fix the mind only, the intellect also should be placed in Him. Why? The intellect is the deciding power, and without its direction, the mind wavers and wanders away from the goal. The mind thinks and reason decides. It is reason (‘buddhi’) which takes the final decision that the Lord alone is real and all else is like water in a mirage. By the very power of this decision, the mind becomes one-pointed and is then established in God. If the mind wavers, it is because the intellect has not decided right. So the Lord here says that the intellect should be placed in Him. Then meditation becomes deep and firm. Man then lives in God. Like salt dissolving in water, the mind becomes that which it contemplates. Thinking of the Lord, by giving up all the evil qualities arising from ignorance and past samskaras is Moksha. This is what is meant by living in God. The Lord adds-there is no doubt about this. “Follow this practice, and you shall live in Me”, declares the Lord to all mankind and assuredly confirms his declaration. The devotee’s duty is stated here, and his future is taken over by the Lord.",

A man heard the command of God that he should see his Ideal Deity in a ram. He at once believed it. It is God who exists in all beings.“A guru said to his disciple, ‘It is Rama alone who resides in all bodies.’ The disciple was a man of great faith. One day a dog snatched a piece of bread from him and started to run away. He ran after the dog, with a jar of butter in his hand, and cried again and again: ‘O Rama, stand still a minute. That bread hasn’t been buttered.’“What tremendous faith Krishnakishore had! He used to say, ‘By chanting “Om Krishna, Om Rama”, one gets the result of a million sandhyas.’ Once he said to me secretly, ‘I don’t like the sandhya and other devotions any more; but don’t tell anyone.’“Sometimes I too feel that way. The Mother reveals to me that She Herself has become everything. One day I was coming from the pine-grove toward the Panchavati. A dog followed me. I stood still for a while near the Panchavati.

That is, all work should be done in a spirit of self-surrender to God. Bad actions are not included here, because they are already prohibited by the Sastras. No one should do sinful acts. Worship of God, singing His name and glory, charity, works of social welfare, all these are good actions and they should be surrendered to God.(Isvararpanam, Ramarpanam, or Krishnarpanam). As several paths are suggested, each man may take up any practice suitable to his physical and mental predisposition. This last path is within the reach of all persons. While walking, let it be thought of aspradakshinamof God. While talking let it be thought of as singing His glory. This may be extended to all actions. By this, the Lord is constantly kept in view, and the mind, without any strain comes to entertain Godly ideas in a natural way. The Lord has already said“mamanusmara yudhya ca”– “Remember Me and fight.” So, this path is the easiest and the best-fitted for all sincere seekers on the spiritual path. All sin is destroyed, the mind becomes pure, and liberation is attained ultimately.",

But for the man who has surrendered all actions to God, the mind is always pure.The ‘Tyagi’ enjoys purity everywhere and at all times. Therefore it is said here that ‘tyaga’ is higher than ‘Dhyana’. From this, we understand the superior excellence of ‘Nishkama Karma’. Most people are engaged in work. Very few can renounce work completely. So for the majority of mankind, this path is most suitable and leads them to a higher realisation than ‘jnana’ and ‘dhyana’. Moreover, purity of mind is essential for all yogas.

The higher realisation can be had only after this purity is perfected in the mind and heart.",

One should yearn for God as the cow, with yearning heart, runs after its calf.”PUNDIT:“The same thing is said in the Vedas: ‘O God, we call on Thee as the cow lows for the calf.'”MASTER:“Add your tears to your yearning. And if you can renounce everything through discrimination and dispassion, then you will be able to see God. That yearning brings about God-intoxication, whether you follow the path of knowledge or the path of devotion. The sage Durvasa was mad with the Knowledge of God.“There is a great deal of difference between the knowledge of a house-holder and that of an all-renouncing sannyasi. The householder’s knowledge is like the light of a lamp, which illumines only the inside of a room. He cannot see anything, with the help of such knowledge, except his own body and his immediate family. But the knowledge of the all-renouncing monk is like the light of the sun. Through that light he can see both inside and outside the room. Chaitanyadeva’s knowledge had the brilliance of the sun — the sun of Knowledge. Further, he radiated the soothing light of the moon of Devotion. He was endowed with both — the Knowledge of Brahman and ecstatic love of God. (Source:Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna)",

Ordinary people perform worship either to escape from the displeasure of God or in expectation of fulfilling some desires. All these are low motives. Real worship is not done till devotion overflows the heart and tears roll down from the eyes for a glimpse of God.”(Source: God Lived with Them, by Swami Chetanananda, Ch 7 Swami Ramakrishnananda)",

    "commentary": [
      "In seven verses the Lord ennumerates the qualities which His devotee should possess. Thirty five virtures are mentioned and the devotee who possesses them is dear to the Lord. Each one is a subject of study, and unless the sadhaka acquires perfection in all of them, he is not supposed to have passed the test of a devotee. Let no one imagine that he can by-pass any one of them and get into the higher class! If a man desires to cross over the ocean of samsara, free himself from sorrow and misery, he should attain perfection in these virtues, and on such a man alone descends the grace of God.",
      "God is the same to all. He does not consider anyone to be hateful or dear to Him. Those who worship Him with devotion, He is in them and they are in Him. So acquiring good qualities, the devotee becomes dear to the Lord, and the Lord confers Atmajnana on him, and by it he attains Moksha. Each one of those qualities should be cultivated assiduously by all seekers.",
      "Many may think that they have love for the Lord. That is not enough. They should know if they are the recipients of God’s grace. They should examine themselves and find out what is standing in the way of His grace freely flowing into him. If God’s grace is obtained everything is obtained, for His grace destroys all ignorance in a flash. The Lord is perfectly clear when he declares that only those devotees are dear to Him, who possess the above-mentioned qualities(Yo madbhaktah sa me priyah).",
      "Paramatmais the goal to be attained. The path to reach the goal is sadhana, practice. The Gita expounds more on the practical side of sadhana than the goal to be attained. So it is known as a practical guide to self-realisation. In the Second Discourse, the Lord has explained the nature and state of the man of steady wisdom (Sthitaprajna). Here the nature and qualities of the devotee are stated. In the following Discourse, He declares the qualities of the Jnani. The Daivisampath is explained, starting with ‘abhayam‘ fearlessness. In this way, the practical side of religion is frequently emphasised by the Lord in various ways.",
      "Let the aspirant think of these qualities and make them part and parcel of his life. The first is the absence of any trace of hatred towards any creature. There is no exception to this command. Love and kind feeling toward all creatures is the basic virtue of a bhakta.",
      "Santushtah satatam:The devotee should be fully satisfied and contented. Discontent is a sign of imperfection. Under all circumstances, the devotee should be fully at rest and at peace with himself and the world.",
      "Dhrdhanischayah:Firm conviction in spiritual life is again an indispensable quality. The difficulty with most seekers is that the mind wavers in crucial moments of life. Doubt crops up about the truth as declared by the Guru and Sastras. Does God exist or not? Such doubts cut at the very root of spiritual life.Firm conviction that Self-realisation is the goal of life is the foundation for all growth and advancement.No doubts and surmises and speculations! All these are the ‘tricks’ of Avidya which somehow tries to bring down the aspirant into the world and bind him to the wheel of samsara.",
      "Mayyarpita manobuddhih:The mind and the intellect should be absorbed in the Lord. The intellect being the deciding power, if it is not linked to the mind, the latter disintegrates with hundreds of doubts and fear. Firm decision and immovable faith are essential.",
      "Now what is that good which is to be pursued? The good for him who desires moksha is one, and the good for him who wants dharma is another. This is the great truth which the Lord Shri Krishna, the revealer of the Gita, has tried therein to explain, and upon this great truth is established the varnashrama system and the doctrine of svadharma etc. of the Hindu religion. “He who has no enemy, and is friendly and compassionate towards all, who is free from the feelings of ‘me and mine’, even-minded in pain and pleasure, and forbearing” — these and other epithets of like nature are for him whose one goal in life is moksha.[Source]",
      "The sattva prevailing, the man is inactive, he is calm, to be sure; but that inactivity is the outcome of the centralization of great powers, that calmness is the mother of tremendous energy. That highly sattvika man, that great soul, has no longer to work as we do with hands and feet — by his mere willing only, all his works are immediately accomplished to perfection. That man of predominating sattva is the Brahmin, the worshipped of all. Has he to go about from door to door, begging others to worship him? The Almighty Mother of the universe writes with Her own hand, in golden letters on his forehead, “Worship ye all, this great one, this son of Mine”, and the world reads and listens to it and humbly bows down its head before him in obedience. That man is really “He who has no enemy, and is friendly and compassionate towards all, who is free from the feelings of ‘me and mine’, even-minded in pain and pleasure, and forbearing.”[Source]"

Today, at last, I have come to the ocean. Up till now I have seen only canals, marshes, or a river at the most. But today I am face to face with the sagar, the ocean.” (All laugh.)VIDYASAGAR (smiling):“Then please take home some salt water.” (Laughter.)MASTER:“Oh, no! Why salt water? You aren’t the ocean of ignorance. You are the ocean of vidya, knowledge. You are the ocean of condensed milk.” (All laugh.)VIDYASAGAR:“Well, you may put it that way.The pundit became silent. Sri Ramakrishna said: “Your activities are inspired by sattva. Though they are rajasic, they are influenced by sattva. Compassion springs from sattva. Though work for the good of others belongs to rajas, yet this rajas has sattva for its basis and is not harmful. Suka and other sages cherished compassion in their minds to give people religious instruction, to teach them about God. You are distributing food and learning. That is good too. If these activities are done in a selfless spirit they lead to God. But most people work for fame or to acquire merit. Their activities are not selfless. Besides, you are already a siddha.” (Literally, “perfect” or “boiled”; the word is applied both to the perfected soul and to boiled things.)VIDYASAGAR:“How is that, sir?”MASTER (laughing):“When potatoes and other vegetables are well cooked, they become soft and tender. And you possess such a tender nature! You are so compassionate!” (Laughter.)VIDYASAGAR (laughing):“But when the paste of kalai pulse is boiled it becomes all the harder.”",
      "MASTER:“But you don’t belong to that class. Mere pundits are like diseased fruit that becomes hard and will not ripen at all. Such fruit has neither the freshness of green fruit nor the flavour of ripe. Vultures soar very high in the sky, but their eyes are fixed on rotten carrion on the ground. The book-learned are reputed to be wise, but they are attached to ‘woman and gold’. Like the vultures, they are in search of carrion. They are attached to the world of ignorance. Compassion, love of God, and renunciation are the glories of true knowledge.“Vidyasagar listened to these words in silence. The others, too, gazed at the Master and were attentive to every word he said.",

      "MASTER:“As the All-pervading Spirit He exists in all beings, even in the ant. But the manifestations of His Power are different in different beings; otherwise, how can one person put ten to flight, while another can’t face even one? And why do all people respect you? Have you grown a pair of horns? (Laughter.) You have more compassion and learning. Therefore people honour you and come to pay you their respects. Don’t you agree with me?”",
      "Vidyasagar smiled.",
      "The Master continued:“There is nothing in mere scholarship. The object of study is to find means of knowing God and realizing Him. A holy man had a book. When asked what it contained, he opened it and showed that on all the pages were written the words ‘Om Rama’, and nothing else.",
      "“What is the significance of theGita? It is what you find by repeating the word ten times. It is then reversed into ‘tagi’, which means a person who has renounced everything for God.

Joy and sorrow are pairs of opposites (dvandas) which stand in the way of realisation. Unless the mind is freed from these pairs, firmness in self-realisation is impossible.",
      "subbhasubhaparityagi:This may give rise to doubt for the reader. The way of the world is to give up ‘asubha’ and hold on to ‘subha’. Here it is stated that both should be renounced. We must understand these statements continuously by studying the context of each of these thoughts. Here the ultimate goal of ‘Bhakti’ is being declared. The final end of Bhakti and Jnana are the same. The perfect devotee and the perfect ‘Jnani’, both have their life and being in the Divine, the Atma. This state is that of the ‘Jivanmukta’ who has transcended all the modifications of the mind. In that state the pairs of opposites like heat and cold, pleasure and pain, joy and sorrow, good and bad, do not exist. Only the Divine, the Atma exits. So the perfect devotee is free from both good and bad. The seekers should take to ‘subha’ first and eliminate ‘asubha’, and then both should be given up. This is the thought-free (‘nirvikalpa’) state. ‘Subha’ and ‘asubha’ drop away in the ultimate stage when only the Divine appears everywhere for the perfected devotee. This is the idea of subhasubhaparityagi, and not giving up good and auspicious actions."

By His Grace, man acquires ‘buddhi yoga’ (the intellectual keenness to know the essence of things and hold on to truth) and by it, he attains Moksha.",
      "Dharmyamritam:This Dharma is spoken of as ‘nectar’ (immortal) because it takes man from death to immortality. Man is transformed into the Immortal Being. Such is the power of this Dharma. The Lord has showered ‘nectar’ and it is the duty of man to collect it in the vessels of their own minds and drink deep this spiritual drink of God. Those who fail to do so are miserable men and they suffer horrid thirst in the desert sands of worldly life.",
      "Sraddhadhanah:How should this Dharma be practised? With faith. The Lord has emphasised faith a hundred times in the course of His teaching. Moreover, the devotee should be perfectly convinced that the Lord is his goal (matparamah). When the disciple carries out the teacher’s injunctions faithfully, the latter is full of confidence about the future prospects of his student. When the father takes care of the child in his arms, the child has no fear. So also, the devotee who has won God’s grace need not have any fear about his life and spiritual fulfillment. Therefore let all the aspirants strive to obtain these virtues and attain freedom.",
      "“Ye tu”– it is clear that no one is prohibited from obtaining God’s grace by following the eternal ‘Dharma’.",
      "Question:What is the ‘Dharma’ taught by Lord Krishna?",
      "Answer:It is Immortal, and takes man out of the wheel of birth and death.",
      "Question:How should man follow it?",
      "Answer:With faith and deep devotion.",
      "Question:What is the reward?",
      "Answer:Such a devotee is most dear to the Lord."
