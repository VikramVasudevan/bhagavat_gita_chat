    "commentary": "One Paramatma is both with form and without form (Saguna and Nirguna), and so the goal of both forms of worship is the same. Whatever may be the method of worship, if it is practised with faith and devotion, man reaches Paramatma. These two verses deal with persons who seek Nirguna Para Brahmam. This first verse states the attributes of the Imperishable Brahman and the second the qualities necessary for the aspirant for such realisation. Even though the seeker carries on his meditation on the formless Brahman, yet, if he does not possess purity of mind, self-restraint, equanimity, and love for all beings, his effort does not yield the desired results. Without these qualities of good character, realisation of Brahman is impossible. His worship will be like depositing good and relishing eatables in an impure vessel. All of them become corrupt and contaminated by the impurities of the vessel. Both the paths of realisation require the above qualities of character. Therefore the Lord mentions the three indispensable qualities of the aspirant in this context.",

    "translation": "Greater is the difficulty for those whose mind is set on the realisation of the unmanifest (Nirguna Brahman), because the unmanifested is reached with difficulty by embodied beings.",
    "commentary": "It is here declared that for those who are body-minded, the worship of Nirguna Brahman is very difficult. For others it is easy. That is, for the aspirant who is more self-controlled, who has acquired facility in desireless action, the contemplation of Brahman is quite suitable and comfortable. So it should be clearly understood that the difficulty here is only for those who have not acquired purity by worshipping Isvara (God). It should also be remembered that in the previous two verses, the Lord has declared that the goal of both paths is the same, and both require certain qualities without which no spiritual growth is possible.",

    "translation": "O Arjuna! Those verily who renounce all actions in Me, think of Me as the only refuge and worship Me with single-minded devotion and Dhyana, to them I become the saviour and quickly lift them up from the ocean of death and ‘samsara’.",
    "commentary": "In the first verse the path to be followed by the seeker and in the second, the highest reward of such ‘sadhana’ is mentioned. The path of ‘sadhana’ includes three things 1. Renouncing all actions to Him 2. Considering Him as the sole refuge and the highest goal, 3. Worshipping Him with an undivided mind. In this way, if man worships God, He becomes the Saviour and lifts him up from the ocean of samsara. What a wonderful reward for His worshippers! The Lord’s offer should inspire all human beings with joy and faith. They can derive consolation that they shall be freed from the fearful agonising tortures of worldly life. For the individual Jiva who is whirled about from birth to death and from death to birth again and again from time immemorial(Punarapi jananam punarapi maranam), these words of the Lord indeed have the potency of Nectar! What the life-boat is for the drowning man so is the Lord for unfortunate humanity. He would lift them up from this terrible ocean of ‘samsara’. But man should lift up his hand towards God, obtain His grace by devotion and self-surrender. For others who deny Him, who do not think of Him, there is no hope. The Lord is indifferent to them. They should have to wander about in the wilderness of ignorance and death. If man does what is expected of him, the Lord is ever by his side to help him. What can God do, if man refuses to accept Him and seek His help? Therefore the wise man, understanding his terrible fate in the wheel of ‘samsara,’ should strive in every way to obtain God’s grace. Nothing else can cure the disease of worldly life.",

    "transliteration": "mayy eva mana ādhatsva mayi buddhiṁ niveśhayanivasiṣhyasi mayy eva ata ūrdhvaṁ na sanśhayaḥ",
    "word_by_word_meaning": "mayi—on Me; eva—alone; manaḥ—mind; ādhatsva—fix; mayi—on Me; buddhim—intellect; niveśhaya—surrender; nivasiṣhyasi—you shall always live; mayi—in Me; eva—alone; ataḥ ūrdhvam—thereafter; na—not; sanśhayaḥ—doubt",
    "translation": "Fix the mind firmly in Me only; place the intellect in Me, thereafter you shall live in Me only; there is no doubt about this.",
    "commentary": "The Lord is now teaching various practices to reach Him, one after another. The Lord is clear and simple in the teaching, like an able teacher when he is instructing a young boy. The first lesson is fixing the mind firmly in Him. It is not enough to fix the mind only, the intellect also should be placed in Him. Why? The intellect is the deciding power, and without its direction, the mind wavers and wanders away from the goal. The mind thinks and reason decides. It is reason (‘buddhi’) which takes the final decision that the Lord alone is real and all else is like water in a mirage. By the very power of this decision, the mind becomes one-pointed and is then established in God. If the mind wavers, it is because the intellect has not decided right. So the Lord here says that the intellect should be placed in Him. Then meditation becomes deep and firm. Man then lives in God. Like salt dissolving in water, the mind becomes that which it contemplates. Thinking of the Lord, by giving up all the evil qualities arising from ignorance and past samskaras is Moksha. This is what is meant by living in God. The Lord adds-there is no doubt about this. “Follow this practice, and you shall live in Me”, declares the Lord to all mankind and assuredly confirms his declaration. The devotee’s duty is stated here, and his future is taken over by the Lord.",

    "translation": "Even if you are not capable of practice, do work for My sake; By doing work for my sake also, you shall attain perfection.",
    "commentary": "Again the Lord offers an alternate path for those who are not able to get steadiness in meditation even by constant practice. They should engage themselves in doing good actions, charitable deeds of helpfulness, and beneficence to all beings. And such actions should be offered to the Lord, without any desire for personal reward. This is simply Nishkama Karma. Japa, prayer, ‘namasamkirtan’, worship, vows of fasting and silence, all these come under good actions for the sake of God. This is the idea of“matkarmaparamobhava”. By such actions, the mind is purified, and by the purity of mind, liberation is attained. Thus Nishkama Karma leads to perfection. This is recommended to those who are not able to still the mind in Dhyana. Only, those actions should be done in a spirit of self-surrender to God. They should be done to win God’s grace and not for obtaining selfish rewards. This idea should be firmly held in the mind while performing all good work in the world.",

    "translation": "If you are not able to do My yoga taking refugee in Me, then renounce all actions and the fruits there of, self-controlled.",
    "commentary": "The Lord suggests the easiest of all paths here. Man is engaged in a hundred actions day and night in the course of his life. While performing these actions, let him remember God, think of Him as the doer and himself a mere instrument, and surrender all works and their fruits entirely to God. That is, all work should be done in a spirit of self-surrender to God. Bad actions are not included here, because they are already prohibited by the Sastras. No one should do sinful acts. Worship of God, singing His name and glory, charity, works of social welfare, all these are good actions and they should be surrendered to God.(Isvararpanam, Ramarpanam, or Krishnarpanam). As several paths are suggested, each man may take up any practice suitable to his physical and mental predisposition. This last path is within the reach of all persons. While walking, let it be thought of aspradakshinamof God. While talking let it be thought of as singing His glory. This may be extended to all actions. By this, the Lord is constantly kept in view, and the mind, without any strain comes to entertain Godly ideas in a natural way. The Lord has already said“mamanusmara yudhya ca”– “Remember Me and fight.” So, this path is the easiest and the best-fitted for all sincere seekers on the spiritual path. All sin is destroyed, the mind becomes pure, and liberation is attained ultimately.",

    "commentary": "na hrishyati:The devotee is always calm and is not elated with pleasure or joy. Of course, joy is a good quality, but here it refers to the unbalanced fits of elations that overtake the common man when good things come to him. Joy and sorrow are pairs of opposites (dvandas) which stand in the way of realisation. Unless the mind is freed from these pairs, firmness in self-realisation is impossible.",

    "transliteration": "ye tu dharmyāmṛitam idaṁ yathoktaṁ paryupāsateśhraddadhānā mat-paramā bhaktās te ’tīva me priyāḥ",

    "translation": "Who, with faith having Me as their goal follow this immortal and nectar-like Dharma as declared above, such devotees are most dear to Me.",
    "commentary": "The Lord declares the fruit of practising this immortal Dharma. It is natural that people wish to know the reward of spiritual sadhana. It strengthens their faith and prompts them to act. Therefore the Lord proclaims the reward. What is it?‘te ativa me priyah’. “Such devotees are most dear to Me.” – says the Lord. That is the reward. What else does man require? Having the Lord’s grace man has everything, and not having it, man has nothing (though he may possess wealth and kingship even). The Lord’s grace leads to freedom and perfection (Moksha). By His Grace, man acquires ‘buddhi yoga’ (the intellectual keenness to know the essence of things and hold on to truth) and by it, he attains Moksha.",
