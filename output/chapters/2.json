    "translation": "In this manner, when Arjuna was plunged in a state of despondency, with eyes blurred with tears, Lord Krishna addressed these words to him.",
    "commentary": "With eyes blurred with tears:This is the sign of intense dispassion.All earthly attachments and family pleasures and the glories and the enjoyments of dominion appear worthless trash, and Arjuna yearns to escape from the bondage which keeps him as a prisoner in a dark cell. There is only one thought for the prisoner, and that is to regain his freedom and to see the light. So feels the ignorant man, when he is burdened with the weight of sorrow. Such is the experience of Arjuna. It is the first and the foremost qualification for receiving the highest knowledge. One who does not possess this intense dispassion cannot receive the supreme knowledge. Even if it is taught to him, he cannot understand it. It is wasted in the same way as one attempts to dye a dirty piece of cloth. Thus we come to know that Arjuna qualified himself for supreme wisdom by his intense dispassion in the present situation.",

    "commentary": "Dejection:Lord Krishna describes the mental weakness of Arjuna as dirty and wretched. In the same way as dirt covers the physical body the mind becomes impure by sorrow, fear, distress, and hatred. And even as one washes the body by cleansing material, one should clean the mind by the knowledge ofAtma. Arjuna,s mental filth was washed off by the Lord’s teaching. It is the duty of every individual to purify the mind-stuff of its ignorance and passion by a study of the Gita.",

The disease of the mind cannot abate by feeding it with greater wealth, power, and position. To discover this truth is the very first step on the spiritual path. Arjuna understood it clearly. So he confesses that power and lordship over the three worlds cannot remove the withering sorrow. The storm does not abate. The only cure for all diseases of the mind is the knowledge of Atma. It is this supreme panacea that Lord Krishna offers to Arjuna. Therefore it is clear that what one should strive for in this life is not power or position or enjoyment but the knowledge of the Supreme Self.",

The man of knowledge is generally amused when he hears the talk of the ignorant and observes what they say and do. Arjuna was caught in the grip of sorrow, as he did not understand the hidden laws of Dharma. Lord Krishna was the very embodiment of knowledge and Dharma. Therefore the specious arguments of Arjuna, the spurious feelings of pity and compassion, the mental distraction, and physical collapse of Arjuna, raised a smile on the lips of the Lord. Those who have not transcended `avidya’ suffer from a false identification with the creations of ‘Maya’, the body and mind and other worldly objects. The man of knowledge on the other hand knows that he is never contaminated by the modifications of the body and mind, and looks at them from the vantage point of a disinterested spectator.",

However, so long as man is in the embodied state, even the Jnani must go through the physical changes.

Such realised men understand clearly what is real and what is not real. The body and the world are subject to destruction, and so they are not the truth; They are non-existent. That which becomes non-existent cannot have a state of reality at any time. Even if it appears to be real, it is the reality of the mirage only. The Atma alone is real. At no time was it not. At no time will it cease to be. The man of knowledge knows the truth. Others who are ignorant confuse the two by ascribing reality to the unreal (body and the world) and denying the real, (the Atman). This Confusion is the root cause of all sorrow and suffering for mankind.",

We have here a familiar simile to explain a very high vedantic doctrine that the body is just like a garment worn by man and just as these garments are changed from time to time, even so, the Jiva goes on changing the physical body birth after birth. No one grieves when he casts off dirty and torn clothes and puts on other fresh garments. No one grieves when the autumn-withered leaves fall off from the branches. There is always the knowledge that fresh leaves come up with the arrival of spring. The whole of Nature presents such alternate pictures of bareness and beauty according to the changes of seasons. The Lord points out that death is no more than the rejection of the old and decayed body. The Jiva drops off the decayed body by death and adopts a fresh one. So there is absolutely no cause for grief. But of course, to destroy the past karma by supreme jnana, and escape from the cycle of birth and death is the reward of the highest realisation.",

When the mind is purified, it merges in the Atma and disappears, and when the mind disappears the whole of the objective world disappears, and only Atma remains in its own state. How then can the mind understand Atma? Moreover, every object in the world goes through six processes of change -birth, growth, etc. Atma is not born, is not subject to death, is changeless and eternal. It is the eternal subject, the seer, It is the eternal witness of the universe. It is the very essence of Existence, Knowledge, and Bliss. It is the final cause of the Universe.

The Self (Atma) as declared above, is not the body and is not the composition of material elements, and so it has neither birth nor death. So long as man remains in a state of ignorance and identifies with the body, he inevitably passes through the cycle of birth and death. The same man, when he realises his identity with the Self, the procession of birth and death stops for him. The Lord here speaks of the common man who has not understood the secret of his real nature. The purpose of the Lord is to rouse Arjuna from the slough of despondency into which he sank in that hour of test and trial. So He employs every argument both of spiritual Truth and common understanding with equal force and conviction.

Only by experience does a man know the Self and understand what it is and how it functions in the practical world. But, for such direct experience, much good should have accumulated in the past, the mind should have been purified and freed from all bad tendencies. Therefore only the man who has long practiced the control of the senses, (` Sama’ and Dama’), and who has gone through many forms of spiritual discipline, is qualified to enter the domain of the Self. Others, though they enquire after the truth, are far away from understanding and realizing it. When the mirror is clear, the image is reflected clearly in it. A pure cloth can easily be dyed with any color. The seed sown in a watered ground soon sprouts into a plant. Even so, when the mind is pure, the Self is reflected in it clearly. But such men of pure mind are rare. So spiritual experience is a rare achievement for any human being. The same idea is expressed in the Katha Upanishad.",

So long as the body lasts, every being has to do some work or other. This is the inescapable law of our nature. Action being inevitable in the material world, it is necessary for man to do some selfless work, according to his duty, which leads to great good on the physical plane and elsewhere. More so, selfless work purifies the mind and leads ultimately to liberation. It is the duty of a Kshatriya to fight a righteous war. The Lord emphasizes the righteousness of the undertaking. Otherwise, it would be an unrighteous war resulting only in hatred, sorrow, and death, and no merit comes to anyone.",

But there is no fear for him, successful or otherwise. In both ways, a new vista of joy and glory is open to him. In the 6th Chapter, the Lord refers to the future of an aspirant whose body falls before the completion of his Sadhana. Such a man, the Lord says, goes to higher world and is reborn in families of wealth and spiritual development. Therefore the Lord exhorts everyone not to relax or be disheartened in the battle with Avidya, but continue his practice relentlessly till the final goal is reached.",

It means that work should be done in a spirit of surrendering the fruits to the Lord. At all times, and under all circumstances, man should keep the mind free from the desire for the fruits of work. Otherwise, the mind cannot be brought to a condition of peace and restfulness, and one-pointed concentration becomes impossible. As a man thinks of the results of work, anxieties and fears rush into the mind. Demons of failure haunt the mind. Difficulties and dangers born of imagination, bar the way to work. The emotions are disturbed by the shame of failure and the frustration of defeat. Mental energy is thus wasted in painful passions, and man’s personality is wrecked on the rocks of anger and hatred. Life becomes miserable. This is the practical experience of every individual in the world. Thus, we see that work prompted by desire is a disturbing and not a purifying factor in spiritual sadhana. Unless the mind is purified, man cannot get a glimpse of the Self. Thereforenishkama karmais absolutely essential for spiritual realisation.",

The definition of Yoga should be carefully noted. How can one acquire such perfect mental equilibrium? Such a state can be had only when one transcends the mind and enter the Atmic state. That is the yogic position. The merging of the mind in Atma is Yoga. As this state alone can bring about perfect equanimity, the word Yoga is here applied to samatvam (i.e.) equal-mindedness under all circumstances. Free from any kind of desire, realizing one’s unity with Atma, man should work.",

The mind is distracted by the impulse of the mind, by the outgoing power of the senses in contact with physical objects. Such distraction is a great obstacle to Self-realisation. By the practice of discrimination and nishkama – karma, these distractions gradually disappear. The mind is then calm and collected because it has then overcome the tendency to run after material things. It is gradually fixed in the Self-state and man experiences the bliss of Self-realisation. That is yoga. Yoga means the union of the individual self with the Supreme Being. The Ego which keeps up the delusion of being a separate entity is merged in its own source (i.e.) Self, and then there remains only one Atma, and not two distinct entities as imagined by the deluded mind. Like a bit of salt being dissolved in the ocean, the Ego dissolves itself in the ocean of Sat-Chit-Anand. Then there is supreme peace of blessedness. Till that consummation the mind is troubled. When yoga takes place, there is no mind or Ego existing separately from the Supreme Being. The mind becomes still and immovable because it has become one with That. Then it is all one indivisible ocean of bliss and blessedness.",

We should be able rightly to know whether a person is really a Jivanmukta or not. Arjuna asks the Lord to describe the characteristics of the Jivanmukta so that he could understand who they are and how they live. Of course, man’s character is reflected in his speech and action. The ignorant man is discovered by his tamasic and rajasic qualities and the impurity of his life and work. In the life of jivanmukta, we find peace and purity, divinity and blessedness.

So sense-pleasures of any kind will lead to a downright fall from the spiritual aim. This is emphasized again and again by the Lord. That is why the word Sarvani (all) is used frequently verse after verse. In this verse, two practices are mentioned : (1) Control of the senses from running out and attaching themselves to sense objects, and (2) directing the mind towards the Supreme Lord (merging in Atma).It means rejection of the objective world (Drisya) and identification with the subject (Drik).Both practices are necessary. The first practice alone is not enough. In sleep, the senses do not function, and the objective world is not there. And yet there is no knowledge. So identification with the subject (Drik) is essential while rejecting the objective world (Drishya). It is not enough to clear debts; one should acquire some property. Then he is satisfied. Similarly let a man ceaselessly reject the sense-world as it appears and at the same time, let him think of himself as the pure and perfect Atma. Again, the second practice meditating on Atma is no doubt good, but without the first, the seeker is sure to fall off from the high aim.So the two practices should be undertaken simultaneously.",

There is an English Proverb – “Give me room to sit down, and I can make room to lie down.” Such is the power of Maya that from very small imperceptible beginnings, it grows almost to infinity.",

    "translation": "But the self-controlled man free from attraction and repulsion, with his senses under restraint though moving among objects, attains peace.",
    "commentary": "The man who is able to restrain the senses and control the mind attains peace. He may be using the senses and sense objects for the purpose of sustaining his life, but such work does not befoul the purity and peace of his mind. When the poisonous fangs are pulled out, the serpent is harmless. Similarly, when attraction and repulsion (Raga and Dwesha) are eliminated from the mind, the senses lose their evil power, and then they are only instruments in the hands of man to do what he wants them to do, or to remain quiet in their places. Such a man can move freely in the world and no harm comes to him. When the horses are well under control, the charioteer feels free and happy because they take him easily to the destination without trouble and danger. So the senses help and not hinder the man who has obtained control over the mind.",

    "commentary": "Every individual is seeking for the elimination of sorrow, and the attainment of peace. How can he get them? The path is shown here. By purity and peace of mind, both are acquired. When the mind is freed from impure impulses the aim of spiritual life is achieved.

This peace is attained by constant meditation on the Self. And meditation is possible only when the mind is in a state of balance and harmony. So the first stage is harmony and balance of mind.",

    "commentary": "The seeker should have dispassion towards sense objects like color, sound, form, etc. If the senses are allowed freely to wander in the wilderness of the objective world, there is a great danger. The mind functions through the senses which are constantly in contact with material objects. The mind by its own impurities prompts the senses to seek enjoyment in the objective world. The mind follows the senses and is carried away in various ways. A simile is used to illustrate the idea. The gale carries away the ship on the waters. The ship may capsize by the gale or otherwise be damaged and lost. Likewise, the mind is driven away from Atma and wrecked on the rocks of sensual pleasures. Even a single sense-organ is capable of pulling away the mind from the spiritual goal. If all the senses rebel, what should be the fate of the man?",

    "commentary": "It is not enough to have the senses half-restrained or partly controlled. Every effort should be made to control all the activities of the senses completely. Ceaseless vigilance and perseverance are necessary. The Lord repeatedly states that the senses should be restrained and the mind turned towards God (Atma), for spiritual life. Knowledge should be steady and firm and not wavering and flickering like a lamp placed in the open. Any gust of wind may extinguish it. So are the senses. The little lamp of wisdom is put out by the power of the roving senses, and the attractions of the sense-world. The senses should be withdrawn from the sense objects. The mind should be turned within to look into the Self. There is no use in lamenting that life is full of sorrow and suffering. The Lord is addressing such miserable mortals and is exhorting men to take to spiritual practices and overcome sorrow and delusion.",

What the common man calls day and wakefulness is simply the functioning of the senses in the material world. But it is not so for the yogi who is one with the light of Atma. For him, the senses and the sense-world are not there, but he is fully wakeful in his experience of the Self. So what is a night for the common man, is real wakefulness for the self-controlled. Similarly being awake only in the infinite light of Atma, seeing nothing of the objective world, the yogi finds night in the day when all beings are awake to the diversity of the objective world.",

    "commentary": "The man who is moved by desires and pleasures cannot attain peace. He alone attains peace who has conquered all desires. The man of steady wisdom, the sthitaprajna is compared to the ocean. Though the waters of the ocean are drawn up by the sun in the form of clouds, it is not reduced in any way. So also, though rains and floods join the ocean, it does not expand. It remains the same, immovable. In the same way, the sage of steady wisdom remains unmoved, when all desires flow into him without producing any reactions of the mind or the body. All the enjoyments of the sense-world may come to him, but they are all absorbed in the blissful experience of the Self. He does not recognize them as anything other than the bliss of Self-realisation. He may be put in a palace surrounded by all earthy pleasures. And yet he is indifferent to them. He knows only one Reality one happiness, in which everything is dissolved as all the waters are absorbed by the ocean. Similarly, the sage may be placed on the most painful circumstances and yet he knows only one Reality and one happiness (Ananda). The pain also merges into the same reality and disappears.",

All the practices – restraint of the senses, mind control, abandoning all ego-centric thoughts and feelings, having no consciousness of me and mine lead to the ultimate union of the individual being with the Supreme Self. The individual who thought of himself, as a separate entity now realises that he is no other than the Self, which is the Reality in himself and in all beings. This is the Brahmi-state. By constant meditation on the Self, the individual being becomes that, even as the worm becomes the bee by contemplating on it deeply and continuously. When the Brahmi-state is reached, all delusions cease, all doubts are cleared. The absolute Truth is realised.",
