    "commentary": [
      "With eyes blurred with tears:This is the sign of intense dispassion.All earthly attachments and family pleasures and the glories and the enjoyments of dominion appear worthless trash, and Arjuna yearns to escape from the bondage which keeps him as a prisoner in a dark cell. There is only one thought for the prisoner, and that is to regain his freedom and to see the light. So feels the ignorant man, when he is burdened with the weight of sorrow. Such is the experience of Arjuna. It is the first and the foremost qualification for receiving the highest knowledge. One who does not possess this intense dispassion cannot receive the supreme knowledge. Even if it is taught to him, he cannot understand it. It is wasted in the same way as one attempts to dye a dirty piece of cloth. Thus we come to know that Arjuna qualified himself for supreme wisdom by his intense dispassion in the present situation.",
      "Filled with pity:Kindness is no doubt a great quality. But there are situations when kindness becomes a mental weakness. To be moved with pity after deciding to fight a righteous war for establishingDharmais not nobility of human nature, but a weak state of mind that is not capable of standing up to the strain of duty and righteous action. For the Kshatriya, a righteous war for the sake of justice is a duty. Arjuna was moved by a feeling which amounts to a weak wavering state of mind and it is against this weakness that Lord Krishna’s exhortation is directed. The blessed Lord makes it clear to Arjuna that this is not the occasion and these are not the people for whom he should feel this kind of pity. As a Kshatriya, it is Arjuna’s duty to fight the battle."

      "Dejection:Lord Krishna describes the mental weakness of Arjuna as dirty and wretched. In the same way as dirt covers the physical body the mind becomes impure by sorrow, fear, distress, and hatred. And even as one washes the body by cleansing material, one should clean the mind by the knowledge ofAtma. Arjuna,s mental filth was washed off by the Lord’s teaching. It is the duty of every individual to purify the mind-stuff of its ignorance and passion by a study of the Gita.",
      "Unworthy: There are two types of men in the world – the wise and the ignorant. Those who follow the righteous path, who seek light and purity, who are bold and active, are the wise. This is the aryan way of life. The other category of men live in ignorance, are subject to dark passions, follow the demonic way, and fall into sorrow and despair. This is the un aryan way of life. It behooves everyone to question himself whether he belongs to the former or later class of men, and strive to attain to the level of the wise by determined effort.",
      "Question:What are weakness, sorrow, and fear?",
      "Answer:They are the dirt of the mind. The ignorant fall prey to them. They pull down a man from ascending to higher levels of existence. They bring shame and disgrace."

      "Impotence:Impotence and weakness are characteristics of a eunach. It is the meanest quality in a man. So the ridicules arjuna for such weakness, and exhorts him not to yield to it.",
      "Courage and fearlessness are the first virtue in man. All other good qualities are acquired through them. Therefore in the 16th Chapter,the lord mentions fearlessness(Abhayam) as the first of the twenty-six virtueswhich constitute ‘daivasampada’.",
      "Enthusiasm, daring, courage, right decision, power, and heroism – wherever these six qualities exist, there the Gods dwell. Otherwise, why should the Lord, when he opens his lips to speak, enunciate fearlessness as the first of all virtues on the spiritual path? It is this great ‘mantra’ of fearlessness that came out as the first utterance of the Lord. Though the teacher of the Gita presents various creeds in the course of his message, he insists upon fearlessness as the basic virtue common to all paths of religion. Arjuna’s mental disease has assumed a dangerous form, and the great physician, the blessed Lord, takes out of the medicine case this powerful medicine ‘fearlessness’ and administers it to Arjuna at the very outset. Arjuna’s disease is weakness caused by sorrow and delusion and the Lord’s antidote is absolute strength and courage born out of the knowledge of Atma.",
      "Arise:“Uttishtata, Jagrata, Prapya varan nobhodhata !!!”Arise, awake, and stop not till the goal is reached.So the Upanishads exhort mankind. Likewise, the Lord exhorts Arjuna: ” Stand up, be a man of action, do your duty.”",
      "Scorcher of enemies:This epithet is significant. Arjuna has defeated several external enemies on the battle0field. He is now confronted with unseen internal enemies, sorrow, and delusion. The Lord inspires Arjuna to conquer them, as he conquered other enemies.",
      "Krishna, great psychologist that He is, knows very well that soft expressions of sympathy do not invigorate a drooping soul. Lashing words of strength are needed to rouse its forgotten manliness. Compare what the Lord said, under similar circumstances, to Job: “Gird up now thy loins like a man.” (Bible: Job 38: 3)",
      "In the shlokas beginning with तं तथा कृपयाविष्टं, how poetically, how beautifully, has Arjuna’s real position been painted! Then Shri Krishna advises Arjuna; and in the words क्लैब्यं मा स्म गम: पार्थ etc., why is he goading Arjuna to fight? Because it was not that the disinclination of Arjuna to fight arose out of the overwhelming predominance of pure sattva guna; it was all tamas that brought on this unwillingness. The nature of a man of sattva guna is that he is equally calm in all situations in life — whether it be prosperity or adversity. But Arjuna was afraid, he was overwhelmed with pity. That he had the instinct and the inclination to fight is proved by the simple fact that he came to the battlefield with no other purpose than that. Frequently in our lives also such things are seen to happen. Many people think they are sattvika by nature, but they are really nothing but tamasika. Many living in an uncleanly way regard themselves as paramahamsas! Why? Because the shastras say that paramahamsas live like one inert, or mad, or like an unclean spirit. Paramahamsas are compared to children, but here it should be understood that the comparison is one-sided. The paramahamsa and the child are not one and non-different. They only appear similar, being the two extreme poles, as it were. One has reached to a state beyond jnana, and the other has not got even an inkling of jnana. The quickest and gentlest vibrations of light are both beyond the reach of our ordinary vision; but in the one it is intense heat, and in the other it may be said to be almost without any heat. So it is with the opposite qualities of sattva and tamas. They seem in some respects to be the same, no doubt, but there is a world of difference between them. The tamoguna loves very much to array itself in the garb of the sattva. Here, in Arjuna, the mighty warrior, it has come under the guise of daya (pity).",
      "In order to remove this delusion which had overtaken Arjuna, what did the Bhagavan say? As I always preach that you should not decry a man by calling him a sinner, but that you should draw his attention to the omnipotent power that is in him, in the same way does the Bhagavan speak to Arjuna. नैतत् त्वयि उपपद्यते — “It doth not befit thee!” “Thou art Atman imperishable, beyond all evil. Having forgotten thy real nature, thou hast, by thinking thyself a sinner, as one afflicted with bodily evils and mental grief, thou hast made thyself so — this doth not befit thee!” — so says the Bhagavan: “क्लैब्यं मा स्म गम: पार्थ — Yield not to unmanliness, O son of Pritha. There is in the world neither sin nor misery, neither disease nor grief; if there is anything in the world which can be called sin, it is this — ‘fear’; know that any work which brings out the latent power in thee is punya (virtue); and that which makes thy body and mind weak is, verily, sin. Shake off this weakness, this faint-heartedness! क्लैब्यं मा स्म गम: पार्थ — Thou art a hero, a vira; this is unbecoming of thee.”",
      "If you, my sons, can proclaim this message to the world — क्लैब्यं मा स्म गम: पार्थ — then all this disease, grief, sin, and sorrow will vanish from off the face of the earth in three days. All these ideas of weakness will be nowhere. Now it is everywhere — this current of the vibration of fear. Reverse the current; bring in the opposite vibration, and behold the magic transformation! Thou art omnipotent — go, go to the mouth of the cannon, fear not. Hate not the most abject sinner, look not to his exterior. Turn thy gaze inward, where resides the paramatman. Proclaim to the whole world with trumpet voice, “There is no sin in thee, there is no misery in thee; thou art the reservoir of omnipotent power. Arise, awake, and manifest the Divinity within!”",
      "If one reads this one shloka — क्लैब्यं मा स्म गम: पार्थ नैतत् त्वयि उपपद्यते। क्षुद्रं हृदयदौर्बल्यं त्यक्त्वोत्तिष्ठ परन्तप ॥ — one gets all the merits of reading the entire Gita; for in this one shloka lies imbedded the whole Message of the Gita.[Source]",
      "— “Yield not to unmanliness, O son of Pritha! Ill doth it befit thee. Cast off this mean faint-heartedness and arise, O scorcher of thine enemies.” … In these and similar passages in the Gita the Lord is showing the way to dharma.[Source]",
      "For all of us in this world life is a continuous fight. … Many a time comes when we want to interpret our weakness and cowardice as forgiveness and renunciation. There is no merit in the renunciation of a beggar. If a person who can [give a blow] forbears, there is merit in that. If a person who has, gives up, there is merit in that. We know how often in our lives through laziness and cowardice we give up the battle and try to hypnotize our minds into the belief that we are brave. The Gita opens with this very significant verse: “Arise, O Prince! Give up this faint-heartedness, this weakness! Stand up and fight!” Then Arjuna, trying to argue the matter [with Krishna], brings higher moral ideas, how non-resistance is better than resistance, and so on. He is trying to justify himself, but he cannot fool Krishna. Krishna is the higher Self, or God. He sees through the argument at once. In this case [the motive] is weakness. Arjuna sees his own relatives and he cannot strike them. … There is a conflict in Arjuna’s heart between his emotionalism and his duty. The nearer we are to [beasts and] birds, the more we are in the hells of emotion. We call it love. It is self-hypnotization. We are under the control of our [emotions] like animals. A cow can sacrifice its life for its young. Every animal can. What of that? It is not the blind, birdlike emotion that leads to perfection. … [To reach] the eternal consciousness, that is the goal of man! There emotion has no place, nor sentimentalism, nor anything that belongs to the senses — only the light of pure reason. [There] man stands as spirit.[Source]",
      "In reading the Bhagavad Gita, many of you in Western countries may have felt astonished at the second chapter, wherein Shri Krishna calls Arjuna a hypocrite and a coward because of his refusal to fight, or offer resistance, on account of his adversaries being his friends and relatives, making the plea that non-resistance was the highest ideal of love. This is a great lesson for us all to learn, that in all matters the two extremes are alike. The extreme positive and the extreme negative are always similar. When the vibrations of light are too slow, we do not see them, nor do we see them when they are too rapid. So with sound; when very low in pitch, we do not hear it; when very high, we do not hear it either. Of like nature is the difference between resistance and non-resistance. One man does not resist because he is weak, lazy, and cannot, not because he will not; the other man knows that he can strike an irresistible blow if he likes; yet he not only does not strike, but blesses his enemies. The one who from weakness resists not commits a sin, and as such cannot receive any benefit from the non-resistance; while the other would commit a sin by offering resistance. Buddha gave up his throne and renounced his position, that was true renunciation; but there cannot be any question of renunciation in the case of a beggar who has nothing to renounce. So we must always be careful about what we really mean when we speak of this non-resistance and ideal love. We must first take care to understand whether we have the power of resistance or not. Then, having the power, if we renounce it and do not resist, we are doing a grand act of love; but if we cannot resist, and yet, at the same time, try to deceive ourselves into the belief that we are actuated by motives of the highest love, we are doing the exact opposite. Arjuna became a coward at the sight of the mighty array against him; his “love” made him forget his duty towards his country and king. That is why Shri Krishna told him that he was a hypocrite: Thou talkest like a wise man, but thy actions betray thee to be a coward; therefore stand up and fight![Source]",
      "And mark you, those things which you see in pusillanimous, effeminate folk who speak in a nasal tone chewing every syllable, whose voice is as thin as of one who has been starving for a week, who are like a tattered wet rag, who never protest or are moved even if kicked by anybody — those are the signs of the lowest tamas, those are the signs of death, not of sattva — all corruption and stench. It is because Arjuna was going to fall into the ranks of these men that the Lord is explaining matters to him so elaborately in the Gita. Is that not the fact? Listen to the very first words that came out of the mouth of the Lord, “क्लैब्यं मा स्म गम: पार्थ नैतत् त्वयि उपपद्यते — Yield not to unmanliness, O Partha! Ill doth it befit thee!” and then later, “तस्मात्त्वमुत्तिष्ठ यशो लभस्व — Therefore do thou arise and acquire fame.” Coming under the influence of the Jains, Buddhas, and others, we have joined the lines of those tamasika people. During these last thousand years, the whole country is filling the air with the name of the Lord and is sending its prayers to Him; and the Lord is never lending His ears to them. And why should He? When even man never hears the cries of the fool, do you think God will? Now the only way out is to listen to the words of the Lord in the Gita, “क्लैब्यं मा स्म गम: पार्थ नैतत् त्वयि उपपद्यते — Yield not to unmanliness, O Partha!” “तस्मात्त्वमुत्तिष्ठ यशो लभस्व — Therefore do thou arise and acquire fame.”[Source]",
      "“A man endowed with tamasic bhakti has burning faith. Such a devotee literally extorts boons from God, even as a robber falls upon a man and plunders his money. ‘Bind! Beat! Kill!’ — that is his way, the way of the dacoits.” …..",
      "Then he said, “One must take the firm attitude: ‘What? I have chanted the Mother’s name. How can I be a sinner any more? I am Her child, heir to Her powers and glories.’",
      "“If you can give a spiritual turn to your tamas, you can realise God with its help. Force your demands on God. He is by no means a stranger to you. He is indeed your very own.",
      "“Again, you see, the quality of tamas can be used for the welfare of others. There are three classes of physicians: superior, mediocre, and inferior. The physician who feels the patient’s pulse and just says to him, ‘Take the medicine regularly’ belongs to the inferior class. He doesn’t care to inquire whether or not the patient has actually taken the medicine. The mediocre physician is he who in various ways persuades the patient to take the medicine, and says to him sweetly: ‘My good man, how will you be cured unless you use the medicine? Take this medicine. I have made it for you myself.’ But he who, finding the patient stubbornly refusing to take the medicine, forces it down his throat, going so far as to put his knee on the patient’s chest is the best physician. This is the manifestation of the tamas of the physician. It doesn’t injure the patient; on the contrary, it does him good.",
      "“Like the physicians, there are three types of religious teachers. The inferior teacher only gives instruction to the disciples but makes no inquiries about their progress. The mediocre teacher, for the good of the student, makes repeated efforts to bring the instruction home to him, begs him to assimilate it, and shows him love in many other ways. But there is a type of teacher who goes to the length of using force when he finds the student persistently unyielding; I call him the best teacher.” (Source:Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna)",
      "The Bhagavad Gita, as is well-known, deals with all aspects of life: physical, mental, moral, and spiritual. In this comprehensive scheme, the first step in our evolution is to develop a well-defined personality. An average person’s identity or personality is an unstable, bewildering jumble of the external world, body, and mind. As a result of this inner disharmony, many people end up living aimless, thoughtless lives. So in this process of self-discovery, it’s imperative that one develops a strong character, a distinct unwavering sense of self-identity and purpose. In the language of the Gita, become manly. ‘Do not yield to unmanliness, O Partha, it is not worthy of you.’ Have faith in yourself, stand up and fight the battle of life with firmness of mind, clarity and inner strength. This step toward becoming autonomous is what Swami Vivekananda calls manliness, or man-making. That’s why Sri Krishna exhorts Arjuna to be a man in the true sense of the word. Become a strong person with self-respect, one who is able to defend his reputation by living up to one’s ideals and thereby maintain his position in life with assurance and courage. (Source: Gita for Everyday Living)",
      "Once when I told Sri Ramakrishna that the goal of my life was to attain nirvana [liberation], he reproached me for entertaining such a low ideal. He said: “Those who seek nirvana are selfish and small-minded. They are full of fear.They are like those Parcheesi players who are always eager to reach home. An amateur player, once he sends his piece home, doesn’t like to bring it out again. Such players are unskilled. But an adept player is never afraid of coming out again, if by doing so he gets the opportunity to capture an opponent. Then he rolls the right number and returns home once more. It seems that whenever he rolls the dice, the right number comes up for him. So do not fear.Play without any fear.”",
      "I asked, “Does it actually happen?” The Master replied: “Of course it happens. By Mother’s grace everything takes place. Mother likes people to play. Take the game of hide-and-seek. [In the Indian version there is a granny and a thief who is blindfolded; the other children try to escape being caught by the thief.] The granny likes to have the children run about and make the game go on. She may extend her hand to help a child so he will not be caught by the thief, if she thinks it necessary. Similarly, the Divine Mother is not really pleased with those who seek nirvana, for they want to retire from the game. She wants the game to continue. That is why devotees do not seek nirvana. They say, ‘O mind, it is not good to become sugar. I want to eat sugar.’”— Swami Turiyananda (Source: Ramakrishna as We Saw Him)"

      "The various characters mentioned in the Bhagavad Gita symbolize the different psychological states with which a devotee is identified. When the devotee is identified with the restless mind, he is spoken of as being in the desireful “Duryodhana state,” very difficult to control. The state in which the devotee is concentrated on the human instincts and the prenatal tendencies (samskaras) born of past-life habits is said to be the “Drona state.” When the devotee forgets his true soul nature and is identified with all the circumscriptions of the mortal body, then he is in the ego or “Bhishma state.”",

Similarly, behind every pleasure-filled person, experience or object we encounter in life lies its negative aspect. This is an interesting insight about life. It is rare to find people, experiences or objects that give us pleasure all of the time.  Here’s an example that resonates with us: a new house that was a source of joy in the beginning, will cause grief when one has to pay for its maintenance."

      "Karpanyadoshah:`Kripanah’ commonly means a greedy man, a beggar. It means also a man ignorant of the knowledge of Atma.",
      "The first meaning does not apply to Arjuna, for he was never known to be greedy or a beggarly spirit. Therefore the word should here mean ignorance according to the meaning given in the Upanishads.",
      "In the first discourse, Arjuna speaks. Krishna listens and remains silent. Arjuna speaks of Dharma and Adharma as if he knew the secret laws of righteousness and action. Still, Krishna remains silent. Perhaps the Lord thought that he should not speak till Arjuna asked him to know the truth.",
      "But Arjuna was not a common man. He understood his state of mind and the terrible perplexity and despair into which he was plunged by the tremendous responsibility of the situation. He realised that his own estimate of the situation was not all true as his mind was distracted by sorrow and despondency. So he stops the flow of his own obsessed thoughts and feelings, and simply surrenders to the Lord, to enlighten him and show the right path of action. He assumes the correct position of a humble disciple. The divine Master was pleased with Arjuna’s humility. So it is in the relation between all disciples and teachers. The more humble the disciple is the greater is the love of the surrendered to the Lord with complete faith; Arjuna sought for light and guidance. The Lord at once took upon himself the responsibility of a Guru. He taught him the highest wisdom. He cleared all doubts and answered the questions. He revealed his universal form (Visvarupa) and pulled up the sinking Arjuna from the slough of despondency in every way. Arjuna did a great service to humanity by his self-surrender, for the Lord had then the proper occasion to deliver the message of the Gita to mankind. Let all seekers understand the inner meaning and significance of the subtle relations between the disciple and the master.",
      "Mind Distracted:Nature in its own original state is pure in every man. It becomes defiled and impure by bad elements like lust, greed, and hatred. Without these defiling elements, man’s nature is verily divine and spiritual. The whole attempt of religion is to show the way how to bring back the mind to its original state of purity. The unwise do not seek a remedy even though all of them pass through the same state of perplexity and confusion in solving the problem of life. On the other hand, Arjuna discovered his mental weakness and immediately sought a remedy. What is that remedy? – Taking refuge in the Guru. Who is that Guru? the Blessed Lord Krishna himself. Arjuna surrendered to the Lord and appealed to him, “I am your disciple, command me what I should do?” He fell at the feet of the Lord. His egoism vanished. This is the surest path to spiritual realisation. This is the ship that takes the bound soul across the ocean of ‘samsara’. The Guru is the expert pilot. If he is at the helm, there is no danger of any storm or tempest in life. He takes the disciple who has taken refuge in him safely through all dangers to the heaven of peace and freedom. Therefore the aspirants should surrender to a competent Guru and practice the virtue of humility. Then they receive illumination and realise the Supreme.",

      "Though a man possesses all the power and prosperity in the world and even acquires lordship over the gods, yet it cannot remove the distractions of the mind. The disease of the mind cannot abate by feeding it with greater wealth, power, and position. To discover this truth is the very first step on the spiritual path. Arjuna understood it clearly. So he confesses that power and lordship over the three worlds cannot remove the withering sorrow. The storm does not abate. The only cure for all diseases of the mind is the knowledge of Atma. It is this supreme panacea that Lord Krishna offers to Arjuna. Therefore it is clear that what one should strive for in this life is not power or position or enjoyment but the knowledge of the Supreme Self."

      "As if laughing :`Hasan’ means laughing, `prahasan’ means laughing loud. The man of knowledge is generally amused when he hears the talk of the ignorant and observes what they say and do. Arjuna was caught in the grip of sorrow, as he did not understand the hidden laws of Dharma. Lord Krishna was the very embodiment of knowledge and Dharma. Therefore the specious arguments of Arjuna, the spurious feelings of pity and compassion, the mental distraction, and physical collapse of Arjuna, raised a smile on the lips of the Lord. Those who have not transcended `avidya’ suffer from a false identification with the creations of ‘Maya’, the body and mind and other worldly objects. The man of knowledge on the other hand knows that he is never contaminated by the modifications of the body and mind, and looks at them from the vantage point of a disinterested spectator.",
      "That is the difference between the wise and the ignorant. When a man sees a rope and knows it as only a rope, he is naturally amused to see a man of defective sight who takes the rope to be a snake and jumps about in fear and confusion.The father laughs at the peculiar ideas and behaviour of his little children.So does the wise men smile at the fanciful theories and conduct of the ignorant. Lord Krishna was the master of Yoga and Jnana. To him Arjuna’s peculiar argumentation, his bodily and mental agitation appeared laughable. So a smile beautified the sublime features of the Lord when he observed the mental acrobatics of his former friend and present disciple. Look at this picture and that – the wailing Arjuna and the smiling Lord. Such exactly is the difference between the wise and the ignorant.",
      "In our miseries and struggles the world seems to us a very dreadful place. But just as when we watch two puppies playing and biting we do not concern ourselves at all, realising that it is only fun and that even a sharp nip now and then will do no actual harm, so all our struggles are but play in God’s eyes. This world is all for play and only amuses God; nothing in it can make God angry.[Source]"

      "The teaching of the Gita starts from this Sloka. So in the Gita-Sastra, this verse is regarded as the seed or source (Bija). Just as the whole tree is involved in the seed, the whole of the `Gita Sastra’ is implied in this Sloka.",
      "The message of the Gita starts with the word ‘Asochyan’ and ends with the words ‘ma suchah’ (do not grieve). So it appears that the main purpose of the Gita teaching is “the removal of sorrow.”",
      "Those who should not be grieved for:Every object in the world has five aspects: (1) existence, (2) light, (3) joy, (4) name, and (5) form. Of these, the first three -existence, light, and joy (sat, chit, ananda) are real and eternal. The later two, name and form (nama and rupa) are unreal and transitory. The first three constitute the real nature of man, and not name and form. But such is the power of ignorance (`avidya’) that man sees, knows and clings to the later two only – namely name and form. The first three are not directly seen, though they are experienced every moment of life. Thus, if we analyse and go a little deeper into the real nature of man, we find that it is indestructible and eternal. Only the later two go on continuously changing from time to time. Therefore, since the real man is eternal, one need not weep and wail for the modifications of name and form which he observes in life and death. When the real man is deathless, for whom should we grieve, and for what? That is the Lord’s position.",
      "Words of wisdom:Intellectual arguments are conceived by Buddhi, by which power man comes to decisions after due consideration. But the intellect is finite. It operates within a limited range. It cannot go beyond the Buddhi. Buddhi and the intellect are parts of nature, and they are subject to errors and mistakes in their concepts and conclusions. But it is different with men who have crossed the border land of the intellect and entered the realm of Atma – the superconscious state. He alone knows and speaks the truth. Arjuna did not attain that state. So he measures every thing with the yardstick of his own deluded intellect. His arguments not to fight the battle are of this nature. Lord Krishna dismisses them all in one suggestive phrase (Prajnavadah) and proceeds to state the ultimate position.",
      "The wise:Ordinarily a Pandit is one who is well-versed in the languages and literature, poetry and scripture, logic and oratory. But the Lord here gives a new definition for the word. He is a pandit who grieves not either for the living or the dead.",
      "Again in the 4th Chapter, Pandit is described as one who has burnt up all actions in the fire of ‘Jnana‘. And again in the 5th Chapter, the Pandit is described as one who looks upon all with an equal eye.",
      "So the word should be understood in the higher sense of a man of wisdom. It is necessary that besides mere learning and book-knowledge he should attain the knowledge ofAtmaand receive the grace of God.",
      "There is a conflict in Arjuna’s heart between his emotionalism and his duty. The nearer we are to [beasts and] birds, the more we are in the hells of emotion. We call it love. It is self-hypnotization. We are under the control of our [emotions] like animals. A cow can sacrifice its life for its young. Every animal can. What of that? It is not the blind, birdlike emotion that leads to perfection. … [To reach] the eternal consciousness, that is the goal of man! There emotion has no place, nor sentimentalism, nor anything that belongs to the senses — only the light of pure reason. [There] man stands as spirit. Now, Arjuna is under the control of this emotionalism. He is not what he should be — a great self-controlled, enlightened sage working through the eternal light of reason. He has become like an animal, like a baby, just letting his heart carry away his brain, making a fool of himself and trying to cover his weakness with the flowery names of “love” and so on. Krishna sees through that. Arjuna talks like a man of little learning and brings out many reasons, but at the same time he talks the language of a fool. “The sage is not sorry for those that are living nor for those that die.”[Source]",
      "Even forgiveness, if weak and passive, is not true: fight is better. Forgive when you could bring legions of angels to the victory. Krishna, the charioteer of Arjuna, hears him say, “Let us forgive our enemies”, and answers, “You speak the words of wise men, but you are not a wise man, but a coward”. As a lotus-leaf, living in the water yet untouched by it, so should the soul be in the world. This is a battlefield, fight your way out. Life in this world is an attempt to see God. Make your life a manifestation of will strengthened by renunciation.[Source]",
      "The Brahmo devotees looked wistfully at the Master. Gradually he came back to sense consciousness; but the divine intoxication still lingered. He said to himself in a whisper:“Mother, why have You brought me here? They are hedged around and not free. Can I free them?”Did the Master find that the people assembled there were locked within the prison walls of the world? Did their helplessness make the Master address these words to the Divine Mother?",
      "Sri Ramakrishna was gradually becoming conscious of the outside world. Nilmadhav of Ghazipur and a Brahmo devotee were talking about Pavhari Baba. Another Brahmo devotee said to the Master: “Sir, these gentlemen visited Pavhari Baba. He lives in Ghazipur. He is a holy man like yourself.” The Master could hardly talk; he only smiled. The devotee continued,“Sir, Pavhari Baba keeps your photograph in his room.” Pointing to his body the Master said with a smile, “Just a pillow-case.”(Source:Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna)",
      "—–",
      "The devotees had placed flowers and garlands before him as their loving offerings. He picked up a flower and touched with it first his head, then his throat, heart, and navel. To the devotees he seemed a child playing with flowers.Sri Ramakrishna used to tell the devotees that his divine visions and moods were accompanied by the rising of a spiritual current inside his body.Now he talked to M.MASTER:“I don’t remember when the current went up. Now I am in the mood of a child. That is why I am playing with the flowers this way. Do you know what I see now? I see my body as a frame made of bamboo strips and covered with a cloth. The frame moves. And it moves because someone dwells inside it.“Again, I see the body to be like a pumpkin with the seeds scooped out. Inside this body there is no trace of passion or worldly attachment. It is all very clean inside, and —” It became very painful for Sri Ramakrishna to talk further. He felt very weak. M. quickly guessed what the Master wanted to tell the devotees, and said, “And you are seeing God inside yourself “MASTER:“Both inside and outside. The Indivisible Satchidananda — I see It both inside and outside. It has merely assumed this sheath [meaning his body] for a support and exists both inside and outside. I clearly perceive this.M. and Hirananda listened intently to these words about his exalted state of God-Consciousness. A few moments later Sri Ramakrishna looked at them and resumed the conversation.MASTER:“You all seem to me to be my kinsmen. I do not look on any of you as a stranger.“I see you all as so many sheaths, (Referring to their bodies.) and the heads are moving.I notice that when my mind is united with God the suffering of the body is left aside.“Now I perceive only this: this: indivisible Satchidananda is covered with skin, and this sore in the throat is on one side of it.”The Master again fell silent. A few minutes later he said: “The attributes of matter are superimposed on Spirit, and the attributes of Spirit are superimposed on matter. Therefore when the body is ill a man says, ‘I am ill.'” (Source:Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna)",

This is the most secret of all spiritual secrets. This is the essence of Brahma Jnana.Since Arjuna renounced all the powers and pleasures of the three worlds, Lord Krishna considered him fit to receive the supreme knowledge, and so begins to teach the highest Truth.",
      "Three important facts come out in the Lord’s declaration that all beings are eternal.",
      "This teaching inspires tremendous strength and courage. When a man comes to know that he and others essentially do not perish, there is no cause for grief at all. Death is then regarded as only a change of name and form. When the seed breaks up and grows into a plant, there is no need for grief at all. The name and form of the seed have disappeared, but it is there in the form of a plant. Lord Krishna found out the root cause of Arjuna’s grief and sorrow, and he knew that the knowledge of Atma alone could put an end to all weakness and despondency. So he starts his teaching with the tremendous affirmation of the immortality of the Soul and the deathlessness of the individual being.",
      "All of us hereafter:‘all of us’ – From the point of view of the Supreme Self, there is no separation between God, Guru, and the common man. All belong to the same eternal existence. So we find that Anjaneya speaking to Sri Rama says: (Atma budhya tvamevaham). The individual being manifesting as the ego is the result of the limitations of the body, mind, and senses. When these `limitations are discarded, the so-called individual being, the ego, becomes veritably the all-pervading Supreme Self. That is the Reality. Knowing that he is the immortal Atma, where is sorrow, where is weakness? Thus the Lord inspires Arjuna with courage born of knowledge.",

    "commentary": [
      "Those who do not know that the world is a great illusion consider that the experiences of the senses and the mind are real, and super-impose them on themselves and suffer all through their life. But those who know that these modifications belong to the realm of the body only and that the Self remains untroubled and uncontaminated by them, are free from pleasure and pain, and such men live always in a state of happiness. However, so long as man is in the embodied state, even the Jnani must go through the physical changes. But since he knows the sharp distinction between the body and Atma, his attitude to them is entirely different from that of the ignorant man. So the Lord’s command is ‘endure them’. (`Titikshasva’). There is no other way.",
      "Producers of pleasure and pain:The pleasure experienced by the senses is not pure pleasure. It is mixed with pain. If it is a pure pleasure, it should not have any touch of pain either -before or afterward. Elsewhere in the Gita, it is said that thepleasures derived through contact of the senses with worldly objects are themselves the source of pain. The common experience is also the same. The same thing causes pain and pleasure under different circumstances, in varying degrees.There can be no such thing as pleasure apart from pain. They are the two sides of the same coin.They are called `dvandvas’ – pairs of opposites, which always go together. So the Lord speaks of them together as producers of pleasure and pain (sukhadukhadah).",
      "With beginning and end:When worldly pleasures come no one need be elated, for their nature is not simply to appear but to disappear also, and where there is elation there should be depression. Pleasures come as guests and again depart. They are transitory and short-lived. Therefore one should not get himself attached to them. Such attachment will always lead to pain when they disappear, and it is absolutely certain that they disappear in course of time. He is then the ‘dhira’- the man of courage, who is disinterested in them and feels no attraction for them. The foolish man is deluded by the superficial attractions offered by sense objects, runs after them, and gets himself caught in the whirlpool of Samsara. And besides, even a casual observer knows that not desired by him, several painful things come to him by the power of providence in the cyclic motion of time, and he should be in a position to conclude that even pleasures would come similarly through time, and precious life need not be wasted for obtaining such pleasures. The duty of every thoughtful man is to seek Truth in the midst of this changing phenomena, and the unadulterated Ananda which is pure and perfect and which brings no pain in its wake. The Lord exhorts Arjuna to seek such permanent joy.",
      "Endure:Endure them (Titikshasva). This is one of the great mantras of the Gita. Man should be equal-minded when cold and heat, pleasure and pain, come in the form of an endless chain. So long as man has the body, they come. No one can stop them. So the Lord gives thesatviclaw (titikshasva) – endure them. Like sama and dama – control of the internal and external organs, `titiksha’ – endurance is an absolutely necessary qualification for the spiritual seeker.",

He is firmly fixed in Atma who feels that the pairs of Opposites (`dvandas’) are only modifications of the body and mind. Pleasure is only a wave of the mind, and pain is also a wave of the mind. The Atma is above the mind. It is a witness of these changes. So the firm man is indifferent to them, like Suka in the court of Janaka.",
      "He is fit for immortality:Liberation is known as immortality. The world of name and form is dead matter, Jada. It is subject to birth and death. The state of Atma is deathless. So liberation is not something to be acquired fresh by man, but it is his essential nature. It is not something existing in the Heaven or sky. It is immortality here and now and forever.

Such realised men understand clearly what is real and what is not real. The body and the world are subject to destruction, and so they are not the truth; They are non-existent. That which becomes non-existent cannot have a state of reality at any time. Even if it appears to be real, it is the reality of the mirage only. The Atma alone is real. At no time was it not. At no time will it cease to be. The man of knowledge knows the truth. Others who are ignorant confuse the two by ascribing reality to the unreal (body and the world) and denying the real, (the Atman). This Confusion is the root cause of all sorrow and suffering for mankind.",
      "To deny the existence of the real Atma, who alone is real, is the first error. To assert the existence of the unreal, body and world, is the second error. The first error is known as `asambhavana’ and the second error `viparitabhavana’. By the first error, what is real vanishes and so the eternal Atma becomes something that is far away from us. By the second error what is palpably unreal is taken for the real and thus the ignorant man brings upon himself endless suffering and sorrow. To end the sorrow, it is just enough for the man to see the real as real, and the unreal as unreal. This is the way to peace and the removal of sorrow. The spiritual masters know the secret and hence they are filled with bliss. The ignorant man fails to see the Truth, and so he is caught in the whirlpool of ‘samsara‘ and suffers endlessly.",

You should look on your father and mother as veritable manifestations of God and the Divine Mother, and serve them as such. If a man enters the world after realizing God, he does not generally keep up physical relations with his wife. Both of them are devotees; they love to talk only of God and pass their time in spiritual conversation. They serve other devotees of God, for they know that God alone has become all living beings; and, knowing this, they devote their lives to the service of others.” …….",
      "MASTER:“As long as one has not realised God, one should renounce the world, following the process of ‘Neti, neti’. But he who has attained God knows that it is God who has become all this. Then he sees that God, maya, living beings, and the universe form one whole. God includes the universe and its living beings. Suppose you have separated the shell, flesh, and seeds of a bel-fruit and someone asks you the weight of the fruit. Will you leave aside the shell and the seeds, and weigh only the flesh? Not at all. To know the real weight of the fruit, you must weigh the whole of it — the shell, the flesh, and the seeds. Only then can you tell its real weight. The shell may be likened to the universe, and the seeds to living beings. While one is engaged in discrimination one says to oneself that the universe and the living beings are non-Self and unsubstantial. At that time one thinks of the flesh alone as the substance, and the shell and seeds as unsubstantial. But after discrimination is over, one feels that all three parts of the fruit together form a unity. Then one further realises that the stuff that has produced the flesh of the fruit has also produced the shell and seeds. To know the real nature of the bel-fruit one must know all three.“It is the process of evolution and involution. The world, after its dissolution, remains involved in God; and God, at the time of creation, evolves as the world. Butter goes with buttermilk, and buttermilk goes with butter. If there is a thing called buttermilk, then butter also exists; and if there is a thing called butter, then buttermilk also exists. If the Self exists, then the non-Self must also exist.“The phenomenal world belongs to that very Reality to which the Absolute belongs; again, the Absolute belongs to that very Reality to which the phenomenal world belongs. He who is realised as God has also become the universe and its living beings. One who knows the Truth knows that it is He alone who has become father and mother, child and neighbour, man and animal, good and bad, holy and unholy, and so forth.”(Source:Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna)",

If it is a good action, you will have to take the good effect, and if bad, you will have to take the bad effect; but any action that is not done for your own sake, whatever it be, will have no effect on you. There is to be found a very expressive sentence in our scriptures embodying this idea: “Even if he kills the whole universe (or be himself killed), he is neither the killer nor the killed, when he knows that he is not acting for himself at all.” Therefore karma-yoga teaches, “Do not give up the world; live in the world, imbibe its influences as much as you can; but if it be for your own enjoyment’s sake, work not at all.” Enjoyment should not be the goal.[Source]",

Also I cannot eat meat offered to the Divine Mother.

I will cut my throat with a knife.’ This is the tamas of bhakti.”DEVOTEE:“Can one see God?”MASTER:“Yes,surely.One can see both aspects of God — God with form and without form. One can see God with form, the Embodiment of Spirit. Again, God can be directly perceived in a man with a tangible form. Seeing an Incarnation of God is the same as seeing God Himself.

Has he been protecting me as my guru since my very birth?”MASTER:“It was quite late in the day at Dakshineswar when the storm broke, but somehow they managed to cook the meals. The trees were uprooted You see, this is the fate of the house one lives in.“But when one attains Perfect Knowledge, then one finds that dying and killing are one and the same thing; that is to say, both are unreal. When one is dead, one has not really died; and when one has killed another, the man is not really dead. Both the Lila and the Nitya belong to the same Reality. In one form It is the Absolute, and in another, the Lila. Even though the Lila is destroyed, the Nitya always exists. Water is water, whether it is still or in waves; it is the same water when the waves quiet down.” (Source:Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna)",

      "The Lord adopts the method of explaining his ideas by means of vivid similes. Such comparisons help to make the idea clear to the common man. We have here a familiar simile to explain a very high vedantic doctrine that the body is just like a garment worn by man and just as these garments are changed from time to time, even so, the Jiva goes on changing the physical body birth after birth. No one grieves when he casts off dirty and torn clothes and puts on other fresh garments. No one grieves when the autumn-withered leaves fall off from the branches. There is always the knowledge that fresh leaves come up with the arrival of spring. The whole of Nature presents such alternate pictures of bareness and beauty according to the changes of seasons. The Lord points out that death is no more than the rejection of the old and decayed body. The Jiva drops off the decayed body by death and adopts a fresh one. So there is absolutely no cause for grief. But of course, to destroy the past karma by supreme jnana, and escape from the cycle of birth and death is the reward of the highest realisation.",
      "Bodies:-The plural is used here to show that man has to pass through innumerable bodies, birth after birth, so long as he remains ignorant of his real nature.",
      "Worn out:-We have to interpret this word as bodies whose karmic force is exhausted. We see that people die in child and youth. When the physical body is not supposed to be old or worn out. In such cases, the karmic force for that particular body is exhausted and it falls off accordingly.",
      "The Vedantic doctrine is that the Self remains deathless, passing from one body to another, according to the force ofKarmadone with the body. These bodies(upadhis) continue to change but the real man, Atma, remains unaffected and changeless.",
      "So far [we have discussed] God and nature, eternal God and eternal nature. What about souls? They also are eternal. No soul was [ever] created; neither can [the] soul die. Nobody can even imagine his own death. The soul is infinite, eternal. How can it die? It changes bodies. As a man takes off his old, worn-out garments and puts on new and fresh ones, even so the worn-out body is thrown away and [a] fresh body is taken.[Source]",
      "There are two sorts of races, the divine and the demonic. The divine think that they are soul and spirit. The demonic think that they are bodies. The old Indian philosophers tried to insist that the body is nothing. “As a man emits his old garment and takes a new one, even so the old body is [shed] and he takes a new one.”[Source]",

      "The Jiva is the combination of three factors, body, mind, and Atma. One is subtler than the other. The five material elements can affect the body only because the body is composed of the five elements. They cannot affect the mind, the subtle body, because the subtle body is finer than the gross body. We see that gross matter can break up. or destroy only a gross object. The sword can cut through a plant or human body, but it cannot cut the air or the ether. Finer and finer objects are not touched or affected by gross things, Atma, being the subtlest element nothing can touch or affect it in any way.",
      "From the spiritual point of view, both the gross and subtle bodies are just false creations caused by ignorance (avidya), like the snake in the rope. So the superimposed mind and body do not in any way interfere with or change Atma, which remains always the underlying substratum, like the rope on which the illusion of the snake is superimposed. The creations of the body and mind are like the water in a mirage. They appear to exist, but they have no existence in reality. What exists is Atma and Atma alone. Thus if the seeker contemplates the eternal and immortal Self, he acquires boundless courage and firmness."

    "commentary": [
      "The five elements can only affect the body because it is composed of the five elements. The Self is not a composition. If it is a composition, it should naturally decompose like the body and die. But the Self is deathless. It is One.",
      "Eternal, all-pervading:-By these two epithets, Atma is declared to be beyond time and place. ‘Nityah’ mean eternal (i.e.) having existence in the past, present and future. ‘Sarvagatah’ means all-pervading i.e. pervading the whole universe entirely. Having entered time and space, the Self remains still above and beyond them. Every object in time is subject to time. There is no object which is not finally destroyed by time. Worlds, stars, constellations, all things seen and known are swallowed up by time. And what is most wonderful is that the Self swallows up time and remains as Self. It is known as `antakantaka’. It is eternal. It is eminence. It shines in all as existence, knowledge, and bliss. Such being the truth, how can anyone commit sin against another. The noble ideal of universal love is the logical corollary from this truth that the Self alone exists everywhere, and in all beings. The seeker has thus to eliminate all sin and uncharitable thoughts and feelings against others by the contemplation of the supreme Self as the Lord of the Universe.",
      "Because Atma is all-pervading and universal, there is no question of its moving from one place to another. And so, it is the immoveable (` sthanu’). It is also the ancient (sanatanah). So Sanatana dharma’ would really mean Atma-dharma’. Those who have reached the state of Atma are liberated men, `Jivanmuktahs’ the living-free.",
      "We would describe the soul in these words: This soul the sword cannot cut, nor the spear pierce; the fire cannot burn nor water melt it; indestructible, omnipresent is this soul. Therefore weep not for it.[Source]",
      "So then the Hindu believes that he is a spirit. Him the sword cannot pierce — him the fire cannot burn — him the water cannot melt — him the air cannot dry. The Hindu believes that every soul is a circle whose circumference is nowhere, but whose centre is located in the body, and that death means the change of this centre from body to body. Nor is the soul bound by the conditions of matter. In its very essence it is free, unbounded, holy, pure, and perfect.[Source]",
      "Again, it follows that because the soul is not made of matter, since it is spiritual, it cannot obey the laws of matter, it cannot be judged by the laws of matter. It is, therefore, unconquerable, birthless, deathless, and changeless. “This Self, weapons cannot pierce, nor fire can burn, water cannot wet, nor air can dry up. Changeless, all-pervading, unmoving, immovable, eternal is this Self of man.” We learn according to the Gita and the Vedanta that this individual Self is also vibhu, and according to Kapila, is omnipresent. Of course there are sects in India which hold that the Self is anu, infinitely small; but what they mean is anu in manifestation; its real nature is vibhu, all-pervading.[Source]",
      "You are all materialists, because you believe that you are the body. If a man gives me a hard punch, I would say I am punched. If he strikes me, I would say I am struck. If I am not the body, why should I say so? It makes no difference if I say I am the spirit. I am the body just now. I have converted myself into matter. That is why I am to renounce the body, to go back to what I really am. I am the spirit — the soul no instrument can pierce, no sword can cut asunder, no fire can burn, no air can dry. Unborn and uncreated, without beginning and without end, deathless, birthless and omnipresent — that is what I am; and all misery comes just because I think this little lump of clay is myself. I am identifying myself with matter and taking all the consequences.[Source]",
      "Let me tell you, strength, strength is what we want. And the first step in getting strength is to uphold the Upanishads, and believe — “I am the Soul”, “Me the sword cannot cut; nor weapons pierce; me the fire cannot burn; me the air cannot dry; I am the Omnipotent, I am the Omniscient.” So repeat these blessed, saving words. Do not say we are weak; we can do anything and everything. What can we not do? Everything can be done by us; we all have the same glorious soul, let us believe in it.[Source]",
      "The masses have been told all over the world that they are not human beings. They have been so frightened for centuries, till they have nearly become animals. Never were they allowed to hear of the Atman. Let them hear of the Atman — that even the lowest of the low have the Atman within, which never dies and never is born — of Him whom the sword cannot pierce, nor the fire burn, nor the air dry — immortal, without beginning or end, the all-pure, omnipotent, and omnipresent Atman! Let them have faith in themselves.[Source]",
      "The god went home, and at last found that he was the Self, beyond all thought, one without birth or death, whom the sword cannot pierce or the fire burn, whom the air cannot dry or the water melt, the beginningless and endless, the immovable, the intangible, the omniscient, the omnipotent Being; that It was neither the body nor the mind, but beyond them all. So he was satisfied; but the poor demon did not get the truth, owing to his fondness for the body.[Source]",

      "An object made up of gross elements can be seen by the eye. Atma is not such an object. So the eye cannot see it. Since Atma is beyond thought, the mind is powerless to know it, Atma is the eternal substratum that exists after the mind vanishes. When the mind is purified, it merges in the Atma and disappears, and when the mind disappears the whole of the objective world disappears, and only Atma remains in its own state. How then can the mind understand Atma? Moreover, every object in the world goes through six processes of change -birth, growth, etc. Atma is not born, is not subject to death, is changeless and eternal. It is the eternal subject, the seer, It is the eternal witness of the universe. It is the very essence of Existence, Knowledge, and Bliss. It is the final cause of the Universe. Ultimately the Universe dissolves into Atma and it alone remains without a second.",
      "You should not grieve:The root cause of all sorrow is man’s ignorance of his real nature, and his identification with the body and mind.Thus sorrow takes possession of the embodied being. Sorrow (`Soka’) is the direct consequence of ignorance (`Moha’). But when, by the study of the `Sastras’ and by the grace of God and ‘Guru’, man comes to know that he is not the body but the Self (Atma), all sorrow leaves at once. This is the solution to the whole spiritual problem. Man should know and establish himself firmly in the Self. All spiritual practices are intended to pave the way for this blissful consummation. So long as there is the slightest separation between Atma and the individual being, there is scope for fear and sorrow to enter one way or the other. But when the union is complete, then is only bliss and blessedness all around. Lord Krishna exhorts Arjuna to know the Truth and transcend all sorrow and delusion. From this, we understand that the realisation of the Self is the only way to become free from the twin evils of ignorance and sorrow (`Moha and Soka’). Knowledge alone is the pure light to dispel the darkness of samsara.",

His physical strength could not help him in his mental confusion and sorrow. So the Lord suggests that he should acquire spiritual light and knowledge, besides physical strength and energy.",
      "The Lord argues out the point from the lower level of ordinary human understanding, in order to comfort Arjuna and lift him up to the higher level of spiritual insight. Even if the Self of man is, constantly born and constantly dies, there is no cause for grief; for, whatever dies takes a fresh birth again. The ordinary man whose insight does not go deep enough to comprehend the eternal Atma, sees that the body dies. When it dies, it should have again a birth. It is the process of endless repetition. So, why grieve when the bodies are destroyed? The Lord knows that mere theoretical affirmation of the immortality of Atma may not be immediately understood by his disciple. So he gives a practical reason which the common man can easily understand.",
      "But the practical arguments are mere assumptions of the limited intellect only. Even if it is taken that Atma, like the body, is subject to birth and death and rebirth, there is no need to grieve for the destruction of the body.

      "The Lord continues the argument. For that which is born, there is death, and for that which dies there is birth. This is the unalterable law for the body and all material things. The Self (Atma) as declared above, is not the body and is not the composition of material elements, and so it has neither birth nor death. So long as man remains in a state of ignorance and identifies with the body, he inevitably passes through the cycle of birth and death. The same man, when he realises his identity with the Self, the procession of birth and death stops for him. The Lord here speaks of the common man who has not understood the secret of his real nature. The purpose of the Lord is to rouse Arjuna from the slough of despondency into which he sank in that hour of test and trial. So He employs every argument both of spiritual Truth and common understanding with equal force and conviction. But the ultimate spiritual law remains unchanged by the mundane considerations brought forward to drive home a particular aspect of the Truth."

For one is finite and limited while the other is infinite; one is dependent while the other is independent.(Source: The Sayings of Sri Ramakrishna)",
      "The Rishi said: Nisumbha was killed and Sumbha lying down on the ground could not bear this insult to his kingly honour. With uncontrollable anger, he cried out at Devi, “O weak and wicked Durga! Do not be proud. You are fighting with the help of somebody else.” The Devi said, “I am alone and single in this world. Who is there other than Me here? See, all these many fighting with you are Myself. Now look at Me.” As soon as Devi uttered these words, all those appearances of many entered into the body of Durga, and there was none but Devi, the Single. Devi again said, “Be calm. I alone with the power of immanence and omnipresence appeared as many but now stand single and have withdrawn myself into Myself.” (Source: Sri Durga Saptashati or The Devi Mahatmya (The Glory of The Divine Mother) by Swami Sivananda)",
      "Admin Note: Ocean ana Wave Analogy — Wave was the the ocean, Wave is the Ocean and Wave will be the Ocean. Similar is the case with Gold ornaments and Clay pots. There is no separate entity apart from Brahman. All the things of the world with Name and form are only different manifestations of Same Brahman."

    "commentary": [
      "Spiritual science does not end with mere theory. It is a practical experience. Only by experience does a man know the Self and understand what it is and how it functions in the practical world. But, for such direct experience, much good should have accumulated in the past, the mind should have been purified and freed from all bad tendencies. Therefore only the man who has long practiced the control of the senses, (` Sama’ and Dama’), and who has gone through many forms of spiritual discipline, is qualified to enter the domain of the Self. Others, though they enquire after the truth, are far away from understanding and realizing it. When the mirror is clear, the image is reflected clearly in it. A pure cloth can easily be dyed with any color. The seed sown in a watered ground soon sprouts into a plant. Even so, when the mind is pure, the Self is reflected in it clearly. But such men of pure mind are rare. So spiritual experience is a rare achievement for any human being. The same idea is expressed in the Katha Upanishad.",
      "The man of heroic courage and determination desiring immortality turns the out-going senses and mind inwards and sees the supreme Self.",
      "The Self is not an object to be seen or spoken or heard of. It is beyond the senses and mind. It is the subtlest of the subtle. It is hidden in the inmost recesses of the heart. By selfless action, devotion, dispassion, mediation, and such other methods, the heart should first be purified, and the inquiry for the Self should be continued for a long time before the Self is directly perceived. The Lord does not say that no one knows Him. He means only that such men are rare.",
      "Since the Self is entirely different from any object seen or known, it is looked upon as wonder.",
      "The verse may also mean that the speaker, the hearer, and the knower of the Supreme Being are all men of wonder.",
      "Some look at It [the Self] with wonder. Some talk of It as wonderful. Others hear of It as wonderful. Others, hearing of It, do not understand.[Source]",
      "In the Ramakrishna Incarnation there is knowledge, devotion and love — infinite knowledge, infinite love, infinite work, infinite compassion for all beings. You have not yet been able to understand him. “श्रुत्वाप्येनं वेद न चैव कश्चित् — Even after hearing about Him, most people do not understand Him.” What the whole Hindu race has thought in ages, he lived in one life. His life is the living commentary to the Vedas of all nations. People will come to know him by degrees.[Source]",
      "But it falleth out, that many who often hear the Gospel of Christ, are yet but little affected, because they are void of the Spirit of Christ. But whosoever would fully and feelingly understand the words of Christ, must endeavour to conform his life wholly to the life of Christ.[Source](The Imitation of Christ, V. 2.) (*1)",
      "A BRAHMO DEVOTEE:“Sir, has God forms or has He none?”",
      "MASTER:“No one can say with finality that God is only ‘this’ and nothing else. He is formless, and again He has forms. For the bhakta He assumes forms. But He is formless for the jnani, that is, for him who looks on the world as a mere dream. The bhakta feels that he is one entity and the world another. Therefore God, reveals Himself to him as a Person. But the jnani — the Vedantist, for instance — always reasons, applying the process of ‘Not this, not this’. Through this discrimination he realises, by his inner perception, that the ego and the universe are both illusory, like a dream. Then the jnani realises Brahman in his own consciousness. He cannot describe what Brahman is.",
      "“Do you know what I mean? Think of Brahman, Existence-Knowledge- Bliss Absolute, as a shoreless ocean. Through the cooling influence, as it were, of the bhakta’s love, the water has frozen at places into blocks of ice. In other words, God now and then assumes various forms for His lovers and reveals Himself to them as a Person. But with the rising of the sun of Knowledge, the blocks of ice melt. Then one doesn’t feel any more that God is a Person, nor does one see God’s forms. What He is cannot be described. Who will describe Him? He who would do so disappears. He cannot find his ‘I’ any more.",
      "“If one analyses oneself, one doesn’t find any such thing as ‘I’. Take an onion, for instance. First of all you peel off the red outer skin; then you find thick white skins. Peel these off one after the other, and you won’t find anything inside.",
      "“In that state a man no longer finds the existence of his ego. And who is there left to seek it? Who can describe how he feels in that state — in his own Pure Consciousness — about the real nature of Brahman? Once a salt doll went to measure the depth of the ocean. No sooner was it in the water than it melted. Now who was to tell the depth?",
      "“There is a sign of Perfect Knowledge. Man becomes silent when It is attained. Then the ‘I’, which may be likened to the salt doll, melts in the Ocean of Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute and becomes one with It. Not the slightest trace of distinction is left.",
      "“As long as his self-analysis is not complete, man argues with much ado. But he becomes silent when he completes it. When the empty pitcher has been filled with water, when the water inside the pitcher becomes one with the water of the lake outside, no more sound is heard. Sound comes from the pitcher as long as the pitcher is not filled with water.",
      "“People used to say in olden days that no boat returns after having once entered the black waters’ of the ocean.",
      "“All trouble and botheration come to an end when the ‘I’ dies. You may indulge in thousands of reasonings, but still the ‘I’ doesn’t disappear. For people like you and me, it is good to have the feeling, ‘I am a lover of God.’",
      "“The Saguna Brahman is meant for the bhaktas. In other words, a bhakta believes that God has attributes and reveals Himself to men as a Person, assuming forms. It is He who listens to our prayers. The prayers that you utter are directed to Him alone. You are bhaktas, not jnanis or Vedantists. It doesn’t matter whether you accept God with form or not. It is enough to feel that God is a Person who listens to our prayers, who creates, preserves, and destroys the universe, and who is endowed with infinite power.",
      "“It is easier to attain God by following the path of devotion.”",
      "BRAHMO DEVOTEE:“Sir, is it possible for one to see God? If so, why can’t we see Him?”",
      "MASTER:“Yes, He can surely be seen. One can see His forms, and His formless aspect as well. How can I explain that to you?” (Source:Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna)",
      "Many there are who do not even hear of Atman; though hearing of Him, many do not comprehend. Wonderful is the expounder and rare the hearer; rare indeed is the experiencer of Atman taught by an able preceptor.  (Katha Upanishad 1.2.7)",

      "Always :-The immortality of Atma applies to all time, past, present and future.",
      "The body may belong to any man, beast, or plant or any thing in the universe. The indwelling Atma is the same everywhere. When the body suffers and dies, the ignorant man thinks that he is suffering and dying, and so weeps and wails for the destruction of the body. The Lord here states categorically that the real man is no other than Atma, and so whatever might happen to the body, he is not at all affected by it, even as the sky is not affected by the passage of clouds over it. So where is the cause for sorrow ? Sorrow comes only by the false identification of the Self with the body.To think that you are the body is the very source, the very cause of all sorrow and suffering.It is immediately removed when you come to know that you are Atma. So the seeker should constantly contemplate and realise his oneness with the immortal and ever-blessed Self.",

Action being inevitable in the material world, it is necessary for man to do some selfless work, according to his duty, which leads to great good on the physical plane and elsewhere. More so, selfless work purifies the mind and leads ultimately to liberation. It is the duty of a Kshatriya to fight a righteous war. The Lord emphasizes the righteousness of the undertaking.

      "The righteous war is not a religious war against the followers of other religions. The righteous war may be waged even against our own evil-doer kith and kin (Rig Veda 6.75.19). Life is a con­tinuous battle between the forces of evil and goodness. A valiant per­son must fight with the spirit of a warrior—with a will and determination for victory—and without any compromise with the forces of evil and difficulties. God helps the valiant who adhere to morality. Dharma (righteousness) protects those who protect Dharma (morality, justice, and righteousness).",
      "It is better to die for a right cause and acquire the grace of sacrifice than to die an ordinary but compulsory death. The gates of heaven open wide for those who stand up to vindicate justice and righteousness (Dharma). Not to oppose an evil is to indirectly support it. Very similar ideas are expressed in other scriptures of the world. There is no sin in killing an aggressor. Whosoever helps and supports an aggressor is also an aggressor. Thus, all those who supported Kauravas were basically aggressors and deserved to be eliminated."

But there is no fear for him, successful or otherwise. In both ways, a new vista of joy and glory is open to him. In the 6th Chapter, the Lord refers to the future of an aspirant whose body falls before the completion of his Sadhana. Such a man, the Lord says, goes to higher world and is reborn in families of wealth and spiritual development. Therefore the Lord exhorts everyone not to relax or be disheartened in the battle with Avidya, but continue his practice relentlessly till the final goal is reached.",
      "Determined:-Till the goal is reached the seeker should not give up his practices. Such resolute spirit is necessary for the battle with the subtle force of Avidya. Maya is there waiting to bring down the seeker when he relaxes from his effort even for a moment.",

      "“Arise, awake, and stop not till the goal is reached.” Such an inspiring call is necessary to wake up the man from his painful sleep of ignorance and urge him to meet the challenge of life and face the thousand ills and shocks of life with the sword of knowledge and devotion.",

    "commentary": [
      "This is the starting verse of the theory of Karma Yoga, the main theme of the Gita. In this verse, the Lord teaches the secret of Karma Yoga. Though engaged in various types of activity, a man can live without any taint of sin. That secret lies in the balance of mind, equanimity, and detachment. Man should work without losing his equanimity in the vicissitudes of natural change. Success unbalances the mind by a wave of elation, and defeat by a wave of depression.",
      "This is what the common man experiences in the course of his life’s activity. The Gita propounds equanimity, as the only cure for these mental waves carrying man from one extreme to another. And these mental disturbances are caused by attachment to the enjoyments of life. The seeker should know that he has nothing to gain or lose by victory or defeat in his endeavors. Thus he would be free from the disturbing emotions of pride, egotism, and elation in success, self-pity in sorrow, and despair in failure.When the mind is kept in a state of equanimity, Atma is reflected clearly.How can such a man incur sin?Some people think that the yoga of work is a lower path and that work binds man to the wheel of birth and death. The Lord denies it. It is not the work that binds, but the attachment to the fruits of work that binds.If a man attaches himself to the fruits of work, then he is bound and he has to take a number of births to enjoy or suffer the effect of his works. On the other hand, if the aspirant knows that he has nothing to seek for in the universe, that he is Atma, then he is indifferent to the results of his work. He is equal-minded. This is the secret of Karma Yoga.",
      "Then engage in battle:‘From this, we understand that before plunging into action, one should know and practice the secret of work. The Lord’s command is ‘then fight’ (i-e.) after attaining equanimity of mind. Otherwise, action immediately binds him to the wheel of birth and death. The ups and downs of worldly life and its reactions will throw the man off the gear into a tormented state of pain and suffering. Perfect knowledge should illumine work. Then work becomes worship. Therefore the Lord first teaches Arjuna in the second discourse (Sankhya Yoga) the highest doctrine of Vedanta (i.e), the indivisibility of the personal man with Paramatma, the immortality of the self, and then, comes down to teach the method of work.",
      "“Making pleasure and misery the same, making success and defeat the same, do thou stand up and fight.”[Source]",
      "When I became a sannyasin, I consciously took the step, knowing that this body would have to die of starvation. What of that, I am a beggar. My friends are poor, I love the poor, I welcome poverty. I am glad that I sometimes have to starve. I ask help of none. What is the use? Truth will preach itself, it will not die for the want of the helping hands of me! “Making happiness and misery the same, making success and failure the same, fight thou on.” It is that eternal love, unruffled equanimity under all circumstances, and perfect freedom from jealousy or animosity that will tell. That will tell, nothing else.[Source]",

      "This Karma Yoga, performed with discrimination, is a powerful spiritual force. It never goes to waste. When once it is started, good results flow from whatever is done in this Yoga. There is no harm or adverse effect even if it is stopped in the middle. For instance, when we plant a seed in the soil, we should water the soil constantly. Otherwise, the seed is destroyed. Such is not the case with this Yoga. Whatever is done produces its own good results in proper measure and at the proper time. Nothing is lost and no effort is wasted.",
      "Protects from great fear:-Even a little of this Sadhana protects man from great fear. And what is the great fear of man in this world? Death. The cycle of birth and death constitutes Samsara. By the practice of this Yoga, man transcends this awful fear.",
      "A small spark of fire is capable of spreading and burning up a whole forest; A small ship is capable of taking us over the big ocean. Even so, even a little practice of Karma Yoga protects man from the great ills of life. The seeker need not feel discouraged at all. Though he cannot attain the state of perfection all at once, he should continue this practice, little by little, without intermission. Even it is a piece of worship, or a small mantra – have faith in it and go on doing it as best as you can. This will enable you to cross the ocean of samsara. A bit of medicine, taken with a proper diet, helps a man to overcome a fearful disease.",
      "This declaration is the most encouraging assurance of the Lord to all mankind. Generally, the seekers are discouraged by thinking of the obstacles on the path of spiritual life “How can I swim across this mighty inscrutable ocean of samsara? How can I transcend this limitless darkness of ignorance? Alas! I am not a Rishi. I cannot perform painful Tapas. I have no steadiness of mind. How can I be saved ?” Such is the usual train of thought for the majority of the seekers. Such discouraging thoughts are the real obstruction to progress. So the Lord assures all that whatever little they do will yield the best results and they can work wonders by their faith. This is the Lord’s promise. This is the Lord’s hope for mankind.",

There came once again the same voice that in the Gita preached, “Even the least bit done of this religion saves from great fear.”[Source]",
      "This is teaching on the practical side. Believe, therefore, in yourselves, and if you want material wealth, work it out; it will come to you. If you want to be intellectual, work it out on the intellectual plane, and intellectual giants you shall be. And if you want to attain to freedom, work it out on the spiritual plane, and free you shall be and shall enter into Nirvana, the Eternal Bliss. But one defect which lay in the Advaita was its being worked out so long on the spiritual plane only, and nowhere else; now the time has come when you have to make it practical. It shall no more be a rahasya, a secret, it shall no more live with monks in cave and forests, and in the Himalayas; it must come down to the daily, everyday life of the people; it shall be worked out in the palace of the king, in the cave of the recluse; it shall be worked out in the cottage of the poor, by the beggar in the street, everywhere; anywhere it can be worked out. Therefore do not fear whether you are a woman or a shudra, for this religion is so great, says Lord Krishna, that even a little of it brings a great amount of good.[Source]",
      "Cannot the knowledge, by which is attained even freedom from the bondage of worldly existence, bring ordinary material prosperity? Certainly it can. Freedom, dispassion, renunciation, all these are the very highest ideals, but “स्वल्पमप्यस्य धर्मस्य त्रायते महतो भयात् — Even a little of this dharma saves one from the great fear (of birth and death).” Dualist, qualified-monist, monist, Shaiva, Vaishnava, Shakta, even the Buddhist and the Jain and others — whatever sects have arisen in India — are all at one in this respect that infinite power is latent in this jivatman (individualized soul); from the ant to the perfect man there is the same Atman in all, the difference being only in manifestation. “As a farmer breaks the obstacles (to the course of water)” (Patanjali’s Yoga-Sutra, Kaivalyapada, 3). That power manifests as soon as it gets the opportunity and the right place and time. From the highest god to the meanest grass, the same power is present in all — whether manifested or not. We shall have to call forth that power by going from door to door.[Source]",

      "Sri Ramakrishna:“With the realisation of Satchidananda one goes into samadhi. Then duties drop away. Suppose I have been talking about the ostad and he arrives. What need is there of talking about him then? How long does the bee buzz around? So long as it isn’t sitting on a flower. But it will not do for the sadhaka to renounce duties. He should perform his duties, such as worship, japa, meditation, prayer, and pilgrimage.“If you see someone engaged in reasoning even after he has realised God, you may liken him to a bee, which also buzzes a little even while sipping honey from a flower.”The Master was highly pleased with the ostad’s music. He said to the musician, “There is a special manifestation of God’s power in a man who has any outstanding gift, such as proficiency in music.” (BG 10.41)MUSICIAN:“Sir,what is the way to realise God?“MASTER:“Bhakti is the one essential thing. To be sure, God exists in all beings. Who, then, is a devotee? He whose mind dwells on God. But this is not possible as long as one has egotism and vanity. The water of God’s grace cannot collect on the high mound of egotism. It runs down. I am a mere machine.",

      "“You may say that there are many errors and superstitions in another religion. I should reply: Suppose there are. Every religion has errors. Everyone thinks that his watch alone gives the correct time. It is enough to have yearning for God. It is enough to love Him and feel attracted to Him. Don’t you know that God is the Inner Guide? He sees the longing of our heart and the yearning of our soul. Suppose a man has several sons. The older boys address him distinctly as ‘Baba’ or ‘Papa’, but the babies can at best call him ‘Ba’ or ‘Pa’. Now, will the father be angry with those who address him in this indistinct way? The father knows that they too are calling him, only they cannot pronounce his name well. All children are the same to the father. Likewise, the devotees call on God alone, though by different names. They call on one Person only. God is one, but His names are many.” (Source:Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna)",

      "Faith in Atma (God) is only one concentrated thought. It seeks for nothing else. It does not disperse itself and spread out like the branches of a tree. Though the man is engaged in a hundred tasks, yet the main affirmation of the mind is only one (i.e.) the universality of the Supreme Self. So in all that he does, his mind is firmly fixed in Atma. He sees the same Atma, in all that he does. This is faith. He surrenders the fruits of his work to God. He has no desire to enjoy anything of the fruits of his work. Those who have not cultivated this single-minded faith, attach their minds to various objects of the world, enjoy them in various ways, and go on hopping from one thing to another just as birds hop from one branch to another in search of leaf or fruit. They have no concentration of mind because they have no faith.",
      "The different rays of the sun passing through a concave lens become one, and the heat produced by it is capable of burning up anything. When the rays are separate, they have no such power. In the same way, when the mind becomes one-pointed, it acquires tremendous power. Therefore it is necessary to collect one’s mind and bring it to a focal point. This is possible only when the man is not drawn by the various objects of the world, which he desires to possess and enjoy. So long as man desires worldly objects, there is no rest or peace for him. The only way to acquire such peace is the faith that Atma alone is the real, and everything else is a mere shadow. Having faith in this spiritual truth, the seeker should practice Karma Yoga.",

      "Ignorant men:-These are unwise men. Those who perform rites and rituals for the sake of enjoying the pleasures of heaven are spoken of as unwise men. So, however, learned and versed in the ‘Vedas’ a person may be, he is still an unwise man because he is not able to know the truth and fix his mind on the Supreme Reality. The verse is intended to open the eyes of such persons who have learned much but whose mind dwells on the lower levels of desires, pleasures, and enjoyments. The Lord condemns at every step sense-pleasures either here or in heaven.",
      "Those who take pleasure in the laudatory words of the Vedas:-In the Vedas, the first part is Karma Kanda which deals with rites and rituals for the fulfillment of earthly or heavenly pleasures. “If you perform this ceremony or this sacrifice, you will get this reward”. This part of the Vedas is all-absorbing to worldly men. They cannot think of anything higher. So they declare that Karma Kanda alone is the highest among the Vedas. There are three parts in the Vedas (I) Karma kanda (2) Upasana kanda, (3) Jnana kanda. The unwise cling to the first part, act neglecting the other two which are of higher and higher value. The teacher of the Gita declares that this is a wrong attitude because it is not conducive to spiritual enlightenment.",
      "Minds filled with desires:-Those whose minds are filled with desires arekamatmanah. They are slaves to a hundred desires, for wife and children, for name and fame, for power and position. Whether these are fulfilled or unfulfilled, their minds are restless. How can divinity find a place in the hearts of such people? Desire (Kama) leads to Anger (Krodha) when frustrated. Only when the heart is purified of all this foul and filthy stuff, will God reveal himself in the sanctuary of the human heart.",
      "Desirous of enjoyments in Heaven:-Those who consider heaven (svarga) as their highest goal aresvargaparah. The spiritual seeker sets no value on svarga and all that it offers by way of pleasures and enjoyments. On the other hand, those who discard them as worthless stuff are alone qualified to attain freedom and perfection. Of course, the luxuries of Heaven may be more beautiful and captivating than what we find here. But they are subject to the same laws as we find here. They are subject to death and dissolution. They end in time, Heavenly pleasures are worthless, from the point of view of spiritual realisation also. It is foolish to think that heaven is the highest goal of mankind. The highest goal for man is to know and realise the Eternal Truth. Everything that comes short of it is of no consequence to the spiritual aspirant. Heaven is not the goal, for, when the (Punya) good done by man is exhausted, down he falls from heaven to the earth.",
      "So there is nothing that should draw mankind towards the pleasures of Heaven. They are also intended to satisfy the animal instincts of man, like food and sex. Of what use are they for the aspirants? An understanding of earthly pleasures will help us to know what heavenly enjoyments would be like, and how short-lived and wretched they are to satisfy the man. It is the height of folly to spend a whole life merely for the sake of attaining Heaven by performing elaborate sacrifices, at great cost and labor. There the main aim of spiritual realisation was forgotten. Therefore the Lord directly attacks heaven seeking ritual-ridden religious men and teaches them that they are slaves to their own desires, and with such distracted minds, they can never hope to remain fixed in the ecstatic contemplation of the Self which alone confers immortality and eternal bliss.",
      "Leading to births as the result of their works:-The present birth is the result of past work (karma) and the work one does now leads on to the next birth. So, endless the cycle goes on. This is samsara. The aspirant hopes to reach a state when the cycle stops forever and he attains to a condition of supreme blessedness from which there is no fall. To attain this state, the Lord prescribes the law of nishkama karma as the rule of conduct in this world.",
      "Having innumerable rituals to obtain enjoyment:-The Karma Kanda in the ‘Vedas’ mentions various rites and rituals, ceremonies, and sacrifices, which yield different enjoyments here and in Heaven. Men who are bound by desires are simply drowned in the ocean of Karma Kanda. They cannot come out of it. One desire leads to another, and at no time will these desires end, for they are almost infinite. This is what we find in man’s limited experience or worldly life. So the spiritual aspirant should cut at the root of desires and burn it up into cinders. He has nothing to gain from Karma Kanda. The aim is to root out desire from the heart, and to become pure so that the sanctified heart is at once filled with the blessedness of the Lord. Then alone is man fully satisfied. There is nothing more for him to seek for Eternal Contentment; Eternal renunciation comes to such a man.",
      "Drawn away by that:-Almost the whole of mankind with the exception of rare personalities, are absorbed in the task of getting some reward or enjoyment from their wordly activities. The spiritual seeker should keep away from such men. He should associate himself with men of renunciation, purity, and knowledge.",
      "Cannot be concentrated in Divine Contemplation:-Such men whose minds are disturbed by desire cannot get one-pointed concentration on the Eternal. Desires crop up and draw the mind off its balance. Pleasures and pains upset the mind constantly, like a lake when a storm blows over it. It is agitated, waves rise and fall and the whole lake to its very bottom is in a state of commotion. Such will be the mind of a man who is obsessed with thoughts of worldly enjoyment. He can never hope to get the necessary serenity and concentration to fix the mind on that which is the ever-blessed Reality. So ‘give up desires’ is the Lord’s command.",
      "“Know, Arjuna, the mind that succeeds is the mind that is concentrated. The minds that are taken up with two thousand subjects (have) their energies dispersed. Some can talk flowery language and think there is nothing beyond the Vedas. They want to go to heaven. They want good things through the power of the Vedas, and so they make sacrifices.” Such will never attain any success [in spiritual life] unless they give up all these materialistic ideas. That is another great lesson. Spirituality can never be attained unless all material ideas are given up. … What is in the senses? The senses are all delusion. People wish to retain them [in heaven] even after they are dead — a pair of eyes, a nose. Some imagine they will have more organs than they have now. They want to see God sitting on a throne through all eternity — the material body of God. … Such men’s desires are for the body, for food and drink and enjoyment. It is the materialistic life prolonged. Man cannot think of anything beyond this life. This life is all for the body. “Such a man never comes to that concentration which leads to freedom.”[Source]",

    "commentary": [
      "Deal with things pertaining to the three Gunas:This should be understood from the context to refer only to the Karma kanda of the Vedas. The later parts in Upanishads deal with the Supreme Reality, beyond all conditions and states of mind, thoughhere and therereference is made to the rites and rituals of Karma kanda. The material world comprehended by the senses is conditioned by the three Gunas or attributes of the mind. This world so comprehended is very limited, is transitory, and perishable. Atma, which is the seer of all objective phenomena is not conditioned by the gunas. It is beyond them. It is eternally perfect. The bondage of life is only for those who are subject to the influence of the three Gunas. Birth and death, sorrow and suffering, pleasures and enjoyments, all these do not affect the wise man who has rooted himself in Atma. Therefore the Lord exhorts Arjuna to transcend them and hold to the Supreme Self.",
      "Taking refuge in the pure `Satvic’ state:-The sattva guna mentioned here is notmisra satvawhich is mixed with the other two attributes, rajas and tamas. To transcend the three Gunas, one should overcome sattva guna also. In the early stages of the sadhana, the satvic state is colored by the inherent rajasic and tamasic qualities. As these later two are slowly eliminated, pure satva (sudha satva) alone remains, when the sadhaka experiences the bliss of Atma. But in the final state of realisation, even this is transcended, and Atma alone, unconditioned and attributeless, remains in its own purity and perfection. The mind which has acquired the power to contemplate the Infinite Atma is called Satva. So says Sage Vasishta. Since it is enjoined, nityasatvasthah, it is imperative that the seeker should hold on to that state always.",
      "Having nothing to gain or retain in the world:-Yoga means the requisition of new things. Kshema means the preservation of the things required. The whole world is engaged in these two things, acquisition and preservation. Wealth, name, position, power, health, children, etc., are the things that man is constantly trying to acquire, and preserving them after they are acquired. The Lord’s injunction here is to give up both these things. For the man who firmly believes that Atma alone is the Reality, there is no such thing to possess or preserve, because Atma is everything and everything is Atma. He has nothing to gain or lose. Most worldly people desire to acquire wealth, possession, beauty, and so on. But who is there who desires to rest in Atma? To rest in Atma is the greatest achievement, and when this is achieved, supreme content descends on the man, and there is no restlessness. So the way to transcend the gunas is to hold on to the Atmic state, with perseverance and determination.",
      "“The Vedas only teach things belonging to the three gunas, to sattva, rajas, and tamas.” The Vedas only teach about things in nature. People cannot think anything they do not see on earth. If they talk about heaven, they think of a king sitting on a throne, of people burning incense. It is all nature, nothing beyond nature. The Vedas, therefore, teach nothing but nature. “Go beyond nature, beyond the dualities of existence, beyond your own consciousness, caring for nothing, neither for good nor for evil.”[Source]",
      "“Go thou beyond the scriptures, because they teach only up to nature, up to the three qualities.” When we go beyond them, we find the harmony, and not before.[Source]",
      "The greatest name man ever gave to God is Truth. Truth is the fruit of realization; therefore seek it within the soul. Get away from all books and forms and let your soul see its Self. “We are deluded and maddened by books”, Shri Krishna declares. Be beyond the dualities of nature. The moment you think creed and form and ceremony the “be-all” and “end-all”, then you are in bondage. Take part in them to help others, but take care they do not become a bondage.[Source]",

      "A small well is useful for purposes of drinking and washing. The same use is implicit in the all-filling flood of water. In the same way, all the rewards and enjoyments mentioned in the Karma Kanda of the Vedas are comprehended in the bliss of Brahman. Therefore the knower of Brahman does not care for the desire to fulfilling works mentioned in the Karma Kanda. According to the law ‘fifty is implicit in hundred’ (Sate pamchasat) and according to the truth that in the foot of the elephant the feet of all other animals are comprehended, all the various pleasures and enjoyments are comprehended in the bliss and blessedness of Atma. Therefore the wise man does not hanker after rites and rituals in the hope of enjoyments here or in heaven. It is stated here vijanatah, and so superficial knowledge is not enough, but the deep experience of Atma is necessary for perfect realisation.",
      "One who has realized the Supreme Being will not desire the attainment of heaven mentioned as the fruits of performing Vedic rituals. Scriptures, such as the Vedas, are necessary means, but not the end. Scriptures are meant to lead and guide us on the spiritual path. Once the goal is reached, they have served their purpose.",
      "Ramanuja and others also have given a different interpretation to this verse. For the thirsty man, all the water in the well or flood is not necessary. A few glasses will do. For the sick man, all the medicines in the world are not necessary. One or two suitable medicines are enough. For the hungry man, all the food in the world is not necessary. A few handfuls are enough. In the same way, for the wise man, a few practices mentioned in the Vedas leading to Self-knowledge are quite sufficient. By following them he attains the realisation of the Supreme. All the others are not needed for him. In the Vedas, innumerable Mantras, modes of worship, and works are revealed. The seeker may choose what suits him best to destroy the disease of ignorance and reach the goal of liberation. Here the Lord assures the devotee not at all to be discouraged by thinking that he does not know all the injunctions and practices mentioned in the Vedas.",

      "You have the right to work only, and not to the fruits of work. Let not the fruit of action be your motive, nor let your attachment be to inaction."
    ],
    "commentary": [
      "The doctrine of Karma Yoga is declared in this verse. Man has a right to work, and not to the fruits of his work. It means that work should be done in a spirit of surrendering the fruits to the Lord. At all times, and under all circumstances, man should keep the mind free from the desire for the fruits of work. Otherwise, the mind cannot be brought to a condition of peace and restfulness, and one-pointed concentration becomes impossible. As a man thinks of the results of work, anxieties and fears rush into the mind. Demons of failure haunt the mind. Difficulties and dangers born of imagination, bar the way to work. The emotions are disturbed by the shame of failure and the frustration of defeat. Mental energy is thus wasted in painful passions, and man’s personality is wrecked on the rocks of anger and hatred. Life becomes miserable. This is the practical experience of every individual in the world. Thus, we see that work prompted by desire is a disturbing and not a purifying factor in spiritual sadhana. Unless the mind is purified, man cannot get a glimpse of the Self. Thereforenishkama karmais absolutely essential for spiritual realisation.",
      "Let not your attachment be to inaction:-This should be clearly understood. The Lord’s command is that attachment to the fruits of work should be given up, and not the works. To give up work is a sign of laziness and inaction. It is tamas. It is the negation of spiritual progress. In sleep one does not do anything at all. But sleep is not self-realisation. The walls and polls do not work. They are not philosophers for that reason. Therefore inaction born of tamas should be counteracted in every possible way. The Lord’s command is a hammer blow on all forms of idleness and weakness, which apparently looks like the peace of Jnana. Some people, out of ignorance, spend their time in empty nothingness, imagining that state to be Brahmanishta. Such people fail both in material and spiritual life. It is imperative for them to recognize tamasic inaction as the first enemy in spiritual life. They should wake up from tamas and start doing something good. No one can live without work. Man must do some kind of work or other. Let that work which you do, be done without attachment is the Lord’s command. That will yield the highest fruit of liberation. Nishkama karma is one of the main tenets of the Gita. This is the message which roused Arjuna to the level of heroic action from his present state of despair and delusion.",
      "This key verse of the Gita has confused some commentators and common people who interpret it to mean that one should work without expecting a fruit. This would mean that Lord Krishna should not expect Arjuna to understand and follow His teachings! No one can perform action without expecting some result. This verse means that we should not expect only favorable results of our choices and should accept all results as Prasada (Grace) from God. This is called Prasada Buddhi, BuddhiYoga, KarmaYoga and surrendering to His Will. (See also18.66).",
      "The right outlook on life develops when we fully understand that we have the ability to put our best effort into all endeavors, but we cannot pick the results of our work.We have absolutely no control over all the factors that determine the results. The affairs of the world would not run if all were given the power to choose the results of their ac­tions or to satisfy all their desires. One is given the power and the ability to do one’s respective duty in life, but one is not free to choose the desired results. To work without ex­pecting success or good results would be meaningless, but to be fully prepared for the unexpected should be an important part of any plan­ning. Swami Karmananda says: The essence of KarmaYoga is to go to work just to please the creator; mentally re­nounce the fruits of all action; and let God take care of the results. Do your duty in life—to the best of your ability—as God’s personal ser­vant without any regard for the personal enjoyment of the fruits of your work.",
      "Fear of failure, caused by being emotionally attached to the fruits of work, is the greatest impediment to success be­cause it robs efficiency by constantly disturbing equanimity of mind.Therefore, duty should be performed with detached attach­ment. Success in any undertaking becomes easier if one works hard without being bothered by the outcome. Work is done more efficiently when the mind is not bothered continuously—consciously or subconsciously—with the outcome, good or bad, of an action. Stress is produced when fruit or goal becomes more important than the work itself due to ego.",
      "One has to dis­cover this fact personally in life. A person should work without any mo­tive as a matter of duty for a greater cause of helping human­ity rather than just helping oneself, one’s children, or a few individuals. Equanimity and spiri­tual progress result from selfless service, whereas work with selfish motives create the bonds of Karma as well as great disappointments.Dedicated selfless service for a greater cause leads to everlasting peace and happiness here and hereafter.",
      "The boundary of one’s jurisdiction ends with the completion of duty; it never crosses the garden of fruit. A hunter has control over the arrow only, never over the deer.Harry Bhalla says: A farmer has control over how he works his land, yet no control over the harvest. But he cannot expect a harvest if he does not work his land.",
      "When one has no desire for the pleasure of victory, one is not affected by the pain of de­feat.Questions of the pleasure of success or the pain of failure do not arise because a KarmaYogi is always on the path of service without waiting to enjoy the fruit or even the flower of work. He or she has learned to enjoy the joy of service. The myopia of short-term, personal gain, caused by ignorance of metaphysics, is the root of all evils in society and the world. The bird of righteousness cannot be con­fined in the cage of personal gain. Dharma and selfishness cannot stay together.",
      "The desire for fruit takes one to the dark alley of sin and prevents one’s real growth. Acting only in one’s own self-interest is sinful. The welfare of the individual lies in the welfare of society. The wise work for all of society, whereas the ig­norant work only for themselves or their children and grandchildren. One who knows the Truth does not let the shadow of personal gain fall on the path of duty. The secret art of living a meaningful life is to be intensely active without any motive, as stated below:",
      "“To work we have the right, but not to the fruits thereof.” Leave the fruits alone. Why care for results? If you wish to help a man, never think what that man’s attitude should be towards you. If you want to do a great or a good work, do not trouble to think what the result will be.[Source]",
      "The karma-yogi asks why you require any motive to work other than the inborn love of freedom. Be beyond the common worldly motives. “To work you have the right, but not to the fruits thereof.” Man can train himself to know and to practise that, says the karma-yogi. When the idea of doing good becomes a part of his very being, then he will not seek for any motive outside. Let us do good because it is good to do good; he who does good work even in order to get to heaven binds himself down, says the karma-yogi. Any work that is done with any the least selfish motive, instead of making us free, forges one more chain for our feet.[Source]",
      "Krishna did everything but without any attachment; he was in the world, but not of it. “Do all work but without attachment; work for work’s sake, never for yourself.”[Source]",
      "How hard it is to arrive at this sort of non-attachment! Therefore Krishna shows us the lower ways and methods. The easiest way for everyone is to do [his or her] work and not take the results. It is our desire that binds us. If we take the results of actions, whether good or evil, we will have to bear them. But if we work not for ourselves, but all for the glory of the Lord, the results will take care of themselves. “To work you have the right, but not to the fruits thereof.” The soldier works for no results. He does his duty. If defeat comes, it belongs to the general, not to the soldier. We do our duty for love’s sake — love for the general, love for the Lord.[Source]",
      "What is your motive? Are you sure that you are not actuated by greed of gold, by thirst for fame, or power? Are you really sure that you can stand to your ideals, and work on, even if the whole world wants to crush you down? Are you sure you know what you want and will perform your duty, and that alone, even if your life is at stake? Are you sure that you will persevere so long as life endures, so long as there is one pulsation left in the heart? Then you are a real reformer, you are a teacher, a Master, a blessing to mankind. But man is so impatient, so short-sighted! He has not the patience to wait, he has not the power to see. He wants to rule, he wants results immediately. Why? He wants to reap the fruits himself, and does not really care for others. Duty for duty’s sake is not what he wants. “To work you have the right, but not to the fruits thereof,” says Krishna. Why cling to results? Ours are the duties. Let the fruits take care of themselves. But man has no patience. He takes up any scheme. The larger number of would-be reformers all over the world, can be classed under this heading.[Source]",

The camel eats thorny shrubs, and blood gushes from its mouth; still it will eat thorns.

Through action one acquires knowledge. The guru instructs the disciple to perform certain works and refrain from others. Again, he advises the pupil to perform action without desiring the result.

      "The Lord’s command is that man should work, having established himself firmly in Yoga. What is Yoga? Equanimity of mind in success and failure is Yoga. The definition of Yoga should be carefully noted. How can one acquire such perfect mental equilibrium? Such a state can be had only when one transcends the mind and enter the Atmic state. That is the yogic position. The merging of the mind in Atma is Yoga. As this state alone can bring about perfect equanimity, the word Yoga is here applied to samatvam (i.e.) equal-mindedness under all circumstances. Free from any kind of desire, realizing one’s unity with Atma, man should work.",
      "One should cultivate the habit of remaining steadfast in Atma before plunging into work. Godliness and spirituality should permeate the mind. One should feel his identity with the universal Being. Otherwise, the work he does will bind him to the world. The success and failures, losses and failures of his worldly activities disturb the mind by throwing it up in waves of momentary elation and depression and of pride and despondency. So one should deeply think of the Self and discriminate the real from the unreal. Then only a man can work with real detachment and with a steady mind. That is why the Lord first teaches the yoga of self-realisation and next speaks of Karma Yoga.",

After a few days he went still farther and discovered a gold-mine, and next, mines of diamonds and precious stones. With these he became immensely rich.“Through selfless work, love of God grows in the heart. Then, through His grace, one realises Him in course of time. God can be seen.

      "KarmaYoga is defined as doing one’s duty while maintaining equanimity under all circumstances.Pain and pleasure, birth and death, loss and gain, union and separation are inevitable, being under the control of one’s past deeds or Karma, like the coming of day and night. Fools rejoice in prosperity and mourn in adversity, but a KarmaYogi remains tranquil under all circumstances (Tulasi Ramayan 2.149.03-04). The word ‘yoga’ has also been defined in the following verses of the Gita:2.50,2.53,6.04,6.08,6.19,6.23,6.29,6.31,6.32, and6.47. Any practical technique of understanding the Supreme Reality and uniting with Him is called spiritual practice, or yoga.",

      "We find that Arjuna is addressed asDhanamjayain this and the previous verse. The Lord exhorts him not to be content with worldly wealth and dominion which are perishable stuff but seek and strive for spiritual treasure which is eternal.",
      "In the Gita, the termbuddhi yogais many times used as an equivalent to jnana yoga. Here the term is used in the sense of the discriminative intellect which makesnishkama karmapossible. Buddhi is nischyatmaka (i.e.) the determining faculty of the pure intellect by which Atma is realised, and freedom from samsara is attained. The mind is polluted by various tendencies (vasanas) which bind man to the pleasures of the objective world and carry him on from birth to birth. The discriminative intellect has the power to order the mind and determine what is right from the spiritual point of view. Therefore take refuge in buddhi is the Lord’s advice. When a man brings into direct operation this faculty of the intellect, the dust and heat of passions raging through the material world are cleared up and the perception of Reality becomes possible. The impure tendencies (vasanas) of the mind create a hundred desires, and the man goes on acting for the fulfillment of these desires. Consequently, the cycle of birth and death continues endlessly for the ignorant man.",
      "Desireless work is the open gateway to knowledge and liberation. The two types of work -work with desire for enjoyment and work without desire – are at the opposite poles.Two persons may be engaged in the same work. One does it for personal enjoyment and fame, and he misses the true end. Another does it without any personal thought or feeling. He achieves the true aim and becomes free.So the attitude to work is most important whatever may be the actual value of the work. The ignorant people who cannot see this difference in mental attitude are confused because they find the wise and the ignorant doing the same work externally. The Lord condemns the poor souls who are always seeking small rewards for their little work. They are meanspirited and wretched men (Kripanah). They are carried away helplessly and painfully. Those who work only to enjoy the fruits of their labor are unhappy because one has no control over the results. Why should man make himself a wretched play-thing in the hands of nature? Why should he become a toy in the hands of fate to be turned in a whirl of worthless pleasures and bitter sorrows? The Lord wants Arjuna to be a real man and not merely a show-boy in the hands of nature. Being born as men endowed with intellect and discrimination, it is shameful that people should make themselves slaves and bondmen to nature, forgetting the glory and blessedness of their real Self.",
      "`Seek refuge in the equanimity born of knowledge’. That is the clarion call of the Lord. Through the purified buddhi man attains the supreme.",

I know that the essence of the Vedanta is that Brahman alone is real and the world illusory. And what is the essence of theGita? It is what you get by repeating the word ten times. Then it is reversed into ‘tagi’, which refers to renunciation. The pupil should hear the essence of the scriptures from the guru; then he should practise austerity and devotions. A man needs the letter he has received from home as long as he has not learnt its contents. After reading it, however, he sets out to get the things he has been asked to send. Likewise, what need is there of the scriptures if you know their essence? The next thing is the practice of spiritual discipline.”Girish entered the room.MASTER (to Girish):“Hello! What were you saying about me? I eat, drink, and make merry.”GIRISH:“What should we have been saying about you? Are you a holy man?”MASTER:“No, nothing of the sort. Truly I do not feel I am a holy man.”GIRISH:“I am not your equal even in joking.”MASTER:“I once went to Jaygopal Sen’s garden house wearing a red-bordered cloth. Keshab was there. Looking at the red borders Keshab said: ‘What’s this? Such a flash of colour today! Such a display of red borders!’ I said, ‘I have to cast a spell on Keshab; hence this display.'”Narendra was going to sing again. Sri Ramakrishna asked M. to take down the tanpura from the wall.

      "One who possesses equanimity born of wisdom:-It means a person who is endowed with the discrimination and determining intellect, and who therefore is capable of acting with an equal mind. Such a man is not tainted by good or bad, merit or demerit. Only the bound soul attached to the world is subject to the effect of his actions, good or bad. The wise man rises above these pairs of opposites.",
      "Great men continue to do good work for the welfare of mankind, though they have nothing to gain for themselves by such work. The Lord encourages such good work in several places in the Gita.",
      "The seeker should first stop evil and take to good works. Then he should learn to do good work without the desire for enjoying the fruits of his good work. Thus he would release himself from the bondage of Karma. It is in this sense that the Lord says that the man of a great mind is free from the effects of good and evil. Man attains the actionless state innirvikalpa samadhi, when the bodily organs, the senses, and the mind remain perfectly still. At all other levels, he functions with his body, mind, and senses The wise man uses these intervals in doing good to humanity in every way he thinks fit. Their example should be followed by all seekers. They should train themselves to do good work selflessly, and this opens the path to perfection.",
      "Skill in action:Dexterity in action is yoga. What is this dexterity? It is the capacity to remain detached and equal-minded while engaged in all forms of practical work in the world. Such dexterity is yoga. The present definition – yoga is dexterity in action – is used to cover the entire range of human action with evenness of mind as the determining condition.",
      "Peace, composure, and freedom from Karmic bond­age await those who work for a noble cause with a spirit of detach­ment and do not seek any personal reward or recognition. Such per­sons enjoy the joy of selfless service that ultimately leads them to the bliss of salvation.KarmaYoga purifies the mind and is a very powerful and easy spiritual discipline that one can practice while living and working in society.There is no religion better than selfless service. The fruits of vice and virtue grow only on the tree of selfishness, not on the tree of selfless service.",
      "Generally, it is thought that one works harder when one is deeply interested in, or attached to, the fruits of work. Therefore, KarmaYoga or selfless service may not be very conducive to the material progress of the individual or society. This dilemma can be solved by developing a hobby of selfless service to a noble cause of one’s choice, never letting greed for the fruits dilute the purity of action. Dexterity or skillfulness in work lies in not getting bound by the bonds of one’s Karma or worldly duty.",
      "Our karma determines what we deserve and what we can assimilate. We are responsible for what we are; and whatever we wish ourselves to be, we have the power to make ourselves. If what we are now has been the result of our own past actions, it certainly follows that whatever we wish to be in future can be produced by our present actions; so we have to know how to act. You will say, “What is the use of learning how to work? Everyone works in some way or other in this world.” But there is such a thing as frittering away our energies. With regard to karma-yoga, the Gita says that it is doing work with cleverness and as a science; by knowing how to work, one can obtain the greatest results.[Source]",
      "A vast mass of energy may be spent in vain if we do not know how to utilise it. Karma-Yoga makes a science of work; you learn by it how best to utilise all the workings of this world.[Source]",
      "“Skill in action is called yoga.” This means that the same action, when it is done ordinarily, becomes the source of bondage; and when this action is done in the proper spirit, it purifies the mind and eventually destroys bondage. Thus it becomes yoga. For instance, work done with attachment leads to bondage; and when the same work is done with non-attachment, it becomes the cause of liberation. This attitude of attachment springs from yoga. Therefore, this very skill is called yoga.",

He affirms that the man who practices nishkama karma will certainly attain the pure sorrowless state of absolute freedom (i.e.) Moksha.",

If you desire freedom from the bondage of samsara, if you seek for the joy and blessedness of spiritual life, do all your duties whatever they are without attachment for the fruits thereof. Surrender them to the Supreme Lord. Your mind will then become pure. Then the knowledge of Atma dawns of its own accord. The moment you experience the Atmic state, you become free and free forever.”",
      "Whether a person is free from attachment or not is the real test of wisdom. Scholarship, power of speech, expounding the vedic texts – these are for the delight of the learned only. They are of little use unless the man is capable of discriminating the real from the unreal, and rejecting the unreal through ‘Buddhi Yoga’.",
      "Go to the abode free from sorrow:People speak of many positions in the world. They say that an emperor holds a high position. They say that Indra is the Lord of Heaven. Though they are in very high positions still the occupants are caught in the wheel ofsamsara. They have birth and death, joy and sorrow pleasure and pain. There is only one state, one position, where there is not the least touch of pain or sorrow, where it is all an ocean of supreme bliss, and that position is the Atma State, the domain of Brahma Jnana. How to attain it? The Lord shows the path here. Do your duty without attachment and desire for the fruits thereof. That is the secret of Karma Yoga and its consummation is Brahmajnana.",

Beyond darkness is Atma – the abode of light. The Vedas declare it so – (Thamasastu pare). To reach that realm of light, one has to cross the ocean of darkness and go beyond sorrow and delusion (soka and moha). Through nishkama-karma, through hearing the truth, through concentration and meditation on the truth, one should realise the light of Atma. When he arrives at this state, he is filled with the bliss of Atma and has no further need to hear or think of the sastras. He becomes indifferent to them. One should understand that this is spoken of about men of Self-realisation.The seeker should continue to hear the Truth enshrined in the Vedas and the Sastras till he attains the higher state of direct perception of the Reality.",

      "The power of the guru is a special power of the Divine Mother; this power is either dormant or manifest in each human mind. A spiritual aspirant who is devoted to the guru can therefore reach such a high state that this power manifests within him or her also and begins to explain many hidden truths of spirituality. At that time the aspirant no longer needs anyone else to resolve doubts and problems regarding spiritual matters. Krishna said to Arjuna in the Gita (2:52): “When your mind has crossed the slough of delusion, you will achieve indifference regarding things already heard and things yet to be heard.” The aspirant ultimately attains this state.",
      "Referring to this state, the Master said: “Finally, the mind becomes the guru or acts as a guru. The human guru imparts the mantra to the ear, and the divine guru transmits the mantra to the soul.” But there is a gulf of difference between that exalted mind and this ordinary mind. In that state the mind is pure and endowed with sattva quality; it has now become an instrument for manifesting God’s divine power. But when the mind is turned away from God, it longs to be engrossed in lust, greed, anger, and so on.",

    "commentary": [
      "Naturally, the seeker in the initial stages is distracted by the innumerable rites and rituals mentioned in the Vedas for the purpose of acquiring material pleasures and prosperity. The mind is distracted by the impulse of the mind, by the outgoing power of the senses in contact with physical objects. Such distraction is a great obstacle to Self-realisation. By the practice of discrimination and nishkama – karma, these distractions gradually disappear. The mind is then calm and collected because it has then overcome the tendency to run after material things. It is gradually fixed in the Self-state and man experiences the bliss of Self-realisation. That is yoga. Yoga means the union of the individual self with the Supreme Being. The Ego which keeps up the delusion of being a separate entity is merged in its own source (i.e.) Self, and then there remains only one Atma, and not two distinct entities as imagined by the deluded mind. Like a bit of salt being dissolved in the ocean, the Ego dissolves itself in the ocean of Sat-Chit-Anand. Then there is supreme peace of blessedness. Till that consummation the mind is troubled. When yoga takes place, there is no mind or Ego existing separately from the Supreme Being. The mind becomes still and immovable because it has become one with That. Then it is all one indivisible ocean of bliss and blessedness.",
      "So long as the mind is unsteady, yoga (union with the Self) cannot happen. That is why the Lord insists on the immovable steadiness of mind (`nischala’, `achala’). If the hand is shaking it is impossible to pass the thread through the eye of the needle. So also, if the mind is split and fragmented, it cannot enter the Atmic plane.",
      "Therefore the seeker should hear of Atma and endeavor to think and meditate on That. He should listen for a brief while and spend more time in concentration and meditation. That is the way. Moreover, rejecting the objective world as an illusion he should look inside into the fathomless spirit pure, calm, serene, and immovable. The more one practices this inward look, the nearer he moves towards Atma, and furthers away from the superficial distractions of the material world. Thus a moment arrives when the mind gets itself completely dissolved in Atma in samadhi. There is no time limit for this consummation. When the mind becomes perfectly still and motionless and is turned inwards, samadhi is reached, and immediately man attains liberation by the knowledge of his real Self.",
      "Who can work without any attachment? That is the real question. Such a man is the same whether his work succeeds or fails. His heart does not give one false beat even if his whole life-work is burnt to ashes in a moment. “This is the sage who always works for work’s sake without caring for the results. Thus he goes beyond the pain of birth and death. Thus he becomes free.” Then he sees that this attachment is all delusion. The Self can never be attached. … Then he goes beyond all the scriptures and philosophies. If the mind is deluded and pulled into a whirlpool by books and scriptures, what is the good of all these scriptures? One says this, another says that. What book shall you take? Stand alone! See the glory of your own soul, and see that you will have to work. Then you will become a man of firm will.[Source]",
      "The only way to understand Him and the universe is to go beyond reason, beyond consciousness. “When thou goest beyond the heard and the hearing, the thought and the thinking, then alone wilt thou come to Truth.”[Source]",
      "Non-scriptural reading or reading of different philosophical writings is bound to create confusion.Ramakrishna said: “One should learn from the scriptures that God alone is real and the world is illusory.”A beginner should know that only God is eternal and everything else is temporal. After Self-awareness, one finds God alone has become everything. Everything is His manifestation. He is sport­ing in various forms. In trance, or the superconscious state of mind, the confusion arising from conflicting views ceases, and mental equipoise is attained.",
      "Different schools of thought, cults, systems of phi­losophy, ways of worship, and spiritual practices found in the Vedic culture are different rungs in the ladder of yoga. Such a wide choice of methods does not exist in any other system, religion, or way or life.People’s tempera­ments are different due to differences in their stages of spiritual development and understanding.Therefore, different schools of thought are necessary to suit different individuals, as well as the same individual as he or she grows and de­velops. The highest philosophy of pure monism is the topmost rung of the ladder. The vast majority cannot comprehend it. All schools and cults are necessary. One should not be confused because different methods are not meant to confuse, but one should choose wisely.",

M. had never before seen or heard of such a thing. Silent with wonder, he thought:“Is it possible for a man to be so oblivious of the outer world in the consciousness of God?

    "commentary": [
      "Arjuna was anxious to know the characteristics of the man of steady wisdom, the man of self-realisation, the Jivanmukta. It is possible for a man to appear outwardly to be in a state of samadhi. But that is only self-deception and deception of the world. We should be able rightly to know whether a person is really a Jivanmukta or not. Arjuna asks the Lord to describe the characteristics of the Jivanmukta so that he could understand who they are and how they live. Of course, man’s character is reflected in his speech and action. The ignorant man is discovered by his tamasic and rajasic qualities and the impurity of his life and work. In the life of jivanmukta, we find peace and purity, divinity and blessedness. So if one observes, and keeps company with a jivanmukta, he would be able to reform his life accordingly and rise above delusion and ignorance.",
      "Man of steady wisdom and steady intellect (sthitapragnah):These are men of steady wisdom and knowledge (i.e.) men whose mind is firmly established in Atma. The others are of unsteady and infirm wisdom. Their intellect is not purified, nor are their minds rooted in the Self. They are attached to the material world. So the aspirant should follow the footsteps of the sthitaprajna and attain the higher status of spiritual illumination by modeling his life accordingly.",
      "This part of the Gita – from 54 to 72 verses describing the qualities of thesthitaprajnais very important. Mahatma Gandhi used to recite these verses as a spiritual discipline and he has practically acquired that state of steady wisdom by the purity of his discriminative intellect, by his surrender to God, and by his nishkama-karma."

    ],
    "commentary": [
      "Many people go to a holy man and ask him, “Revered Sir, when shall we be free from the ills of life ?” The holy man repeats this sloka in response to their appeal. The auspicious moment of liberation from the ills of life is in the hands of each individual. When you have acquired faith in the eternal Self, and when you carry out the precepts of spiritual discipline when the mind is brought to a state of equanimity, and when it is fixed steadily in Atma, that very moment man is liberated and he becomes a jivanmukta. Liberation is a natural process and not a sudden high jump into the spiritual realm. The Sastras and the holy men point the way, and the seeker has to realise the truth by his own self-effort.",
      "Now, what is that practice which leads to emancipation? Desires should be given up. The Lord uses a strong termPrajahatiinstead ofjahati, implying thereby that desires should be given up thoroughly, and again, not simply some desires but all desires, without leaving the least residue in the innermost recesses of the mind. This is the inevitable and universal law. There is no other way. Even if the smallest seed of desire is left in the pit of the mind, it sprouts and grows unconsciously, and there is always the danger of the seeker being driven out of the self-state and once again plunged in the mire of delusion.",
      "That is what the sastras say. It is not sufficient to partly give up all desires or totally give up some desires only. All desires should be given up totally for all time.",
      "Desires lie concealed in the unseen nooks and corners of the mind. They survive in the seed form of mental impressions. Whenever they come into contact with the objects of the material world through the senses, they spring up with subtle and irresistible force and cause samsara. Bondage and delusion are not in the outside world. They are inside the mind. It is here that the spiritual operation should be conducted, and the diseased mind-stuff cut off. The mind is something like a dark cavern that is only partially visible to man. The lamp of discrimination should be lighted, and there should be a thorough search of the vast dark region to find out the last and least living desire and burn it up into ashes. Just as all the small pebbles in grain are sifted and thrown off before food is prepared, just as all the weeds are cleared off when the garden plants are grown, just as all worms, germs, and pests are removed from vegetable plants, even so, all the desires should be carefully searched for and rejected by the seeker.",
      "These desires are of very ancient origin, as the darkness in an undiscovered cave is there from time immemorial. They have taken root in the subtle body through innumerable births. They are mental impressions (vasanas). Having established themselves firmly by spreading their roots deep into the subtle body, they cause samsara, the endless cycle of birth and death for man. They should be pulled out along with the roots. Otherwise, some little desire left untouched is capable of causing a birth or even a whole series of births. Particles of fire from a half-extinguished heath is capable of destroying a whole colony of huts. Therefore the Lord here insists on complete renunciation of all desires forever. Towards this final renunciation, inquiry into the Self, discrimination of the real and the unreal, surrender to the Lord, company of holy men, and such other practices should be undertaken by the aspirant. The Lord immediately explains what happens when the mind is purified of all desire-breeding impressions.",
      "Satisfied with his mind fixed in Atma:This is the consummation of all spiritual practices to be perfectly satisfied in the Self by the self.  When all the desires are cast off, the mind remains quiet in Atma – the very source of all bliss. Fullness of joy – where is it to be found? It is in the Self. Bliss is not outside in the external objective world. One may go on searching for it in earth and sky, in the fourteen worlds up and down inch by inch, he cannot find it, because it is not there. Of what use is it to search for a thing in a place where it is not? And yet, such is the power of maya that man seeks for it, in spite of repeated failures and disappointments – disasters and calamities, in the objective world. The search is carried and birth after birth, till man tired and exhausted by his pursuit of the hare’s horn, may be out of sheer despair, turns inwards into his own Self, and Lo ! the miracle happens, he finds that joy in his own self; that joy and Self are one. The mind is purified, and in the purified mind, the natural and spontaneous bliss of Atma is reflected in a flash. This is the secret of Vedanta. Brahmananda is not a newly manufactured article by the skill and technology of man. It is already there by its own right, already full, unpolluted, and uncontaminated by any material taint. But it is covered up, misunderstood, and muddled up with extraneous things. To remove the impure covering and discover the natural ananda is the aim of Vedanta. Now, the man of discrimination clears up the dust and garbage from his mind and finds that the happiness which he has been seeking from everywhere in the world, is in his own Self. When the outer covering of moss is cleared, pure water is seen. When the dust is cleared off a mirror, it shows a clear reflection. So also, when the impurity of mind in the form of desire is taken away, the seer Atma reveals himself as the pure and perfect Self of man. The search for happiness ends here. So the Lord points out both the aspects of Vedanta-the practice of equanimity and desirelessness and then the goal to be attained. The practice is the renunciation of desire, and the goal is the experience of Atma. The first is Sadhana, and the second is Sadhya. The practice leads to the goal.",
      "So the first outstanding quality of the sthitaprajna is untainted and perfect bliss. This is his badge, his flag, the banner of his achievement. He is distinguished from others by this characteristic feature. When we find the ignorant people plunged in fear and sorrow, distracted and restless, he alone remains free and blissful in the midst of the ever-changing spectacle of human life.",
      "MASTER:“But after realizing God one finds that He alone has become maya, the universe, and all living beings. This world is no doubt a ‘frame-work of illusion’, unreal as a dream. One feels that way when one discriminates following the process of ‘Not this, not this’. But after the vision of God this very world becomes ‘a mansion of mirth’.“What will you gain by the mere study of scriptures? The pundits merely indulge in reasoning.”PUNDIT:“I hate the idea of being called a pundit.”MASTER:“That is due to the grace of God. The pundits merely indulge in reasoning. Some have heard of milk and some have drunk milk. After you have the vision of God you will find that everything is Narayana. It is Narayana Himself who has become everything.”The pundit recited a hymn to Narayana. Sri Ramakrishna was overwhelmed with joy.PUNDIT (quoting from the Gita):“‘With the heart concentrated by yoga, with the eye of evenness for all things, he beholds the Self in all beings and all beings in the Self.'”MASTER:“Have you read theAdhyatma Ramayana?PUNDIT:“Yes, sir, a little.”MASTER:“The book is filled with ideas of knowledge and devotion. The life of Savari and the hymn by Ahalya are filled with bhakti.“But you must remember one thing: God is very far away from the mind tainted with worldliness.” (Source:Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna)",
      "According to Sri Sarada Devi, desires for knowledge, devotion, and salvation cannot be classed as desires because they are higher desires. One should first replace the lower desires with higher desires and then renounce the highest desires also and be­come absolutely free. It is said that the highest freedom is the freedom from becoming free.",

    "commentary": [
      "The characteristics ofsthitaprajnaare further elaborated here.",
      "Mind not troubled in sorrow:The mind of the sthitaprajna is not troubled by the sorrows. disasters and calamities of life. The sun who is far above the storm clouds is not affected by thunder, lightning, and rain. In the same way, pain and pleasure are the natural reactions of the mind to external phenomenon, and Atma being above the mind (i.e.) transcending the mind, is not affected by its modifications. It remains as the witness of the mind, in the same way, as the Sun is just the witness of what is happening in the lower region of the earth. Vasishta explains to Sri Rama that just as arrows cannot powder a mountain, just as the sea-waves cannot move the mountain on the shore, just as the lotus creeper cannot bind an elephant, even so the sorrows and troubles of the world cannot affect the Jivanmukta, the sthitaprajna.",
      "Who does not hanker after pleasures:The Stitaprajna does not hanker after the pleasures of the body and the senses. He is not thrown off his Self-state when pleasant and delighted things come to him. Pain and pleasure are just two different waves of the mind. One wave is called pleasure and another is called pain. Both are caused by the contact of the mind with external objects. If the object is agreeable, there is a wave of pleasure. If the object is undesirable, there is a wave of pain. The sthitaprajna whose mind is firmly established in Atma is not moved one way or the other when pleasant and unpleasant things occur. The Jivanmukta has found himself one with the ocean of bliss, and as such how can he think of attaching himself to any kind of material pleasure? He knows that these little pleasures are only ripples on the surface of the ocean of bliss and that they are shadowy reflections of his own Self. No one can cling to the pleasures of a dream when he awakens from the dream. If really he desires such pleasures, it only shows that he has not yet fully awakened from the dream. So also, he who clings to worldly pleasures arising from the senses and sense objects is not a Sthitaprajna. Attachment to people, places, and objects takes away the intellect. People are help­lessly tied with the rope of attachment. One has to learn to cut this rope with the sword of knowledge of the Absolute and become detached and free. We have the shining example of Suka, as the Sthitaprajna par excellence. If today we come across a man of such caliber who can look upon pain and pleasure with an equal eye, verily we have to honor him as a Jivanmukta.",
      "Free from attachment, fear, and hatred:Again, it is pointed out that the Sthitaprajna is free from attachment, fear, and hatred. To the man of knowledge, everything appears as Atma, in the same way as everything appears as material objects to the ignorant man. What then can he desire? Whom can he fear or hate? The same truth is declared in the Esavasya Upanishad also.",
      "For the wise man who knows that everything is that one Atma, there can be no delusion and no sorrow. He has realised that all that exists is only the Supreme Self and nothing else. Fear and hatred arise only when there is a second thing. When all this is one indivisible Satchidananda Absolute, where is fear and where is hate? He is himself everything. Can he hate himself? Can he fear himself? No. That is the state of the Jivanmukta, the Sthitaprajna – supreme and transcendental.",
      "Munih:The sage who is engaged in speechless absorption in the Self is a Muni. Only such a strong-willed man of action can ascend the peak of the Soham (I am he), mount. The idle and the lethargic have no chance of winning the goal. The sage who has acquired one-pointed concentration in the Self is Sthitaprajna.",
      "Arjuna asks: “Who is a person of established will?” [Krishna answers:] “The man who has given up all desires, who desires nothing, not even this life, nor freedom, nor gods, nor work, nor anything. When he has become perfectly satisfied, he has no more cravings.” He has seen the glory of the Self and has found that the world, and the gods, and heaven are … within his own Self. Then the gods become no gods; death becomes no death; life becomes no life. Everything has changed. “A man is said to be [illumined] if his will has become firm, if his mind is not disturbed by misery, if he does not desire any happiness, if he is free of all [attachment], of all fear, of all anger.[Source]",

      "Without attachment in all things:One should be detached from and indifferent to everything in the world. Of course, no one is attached to unpleasant things. A similar attitude is to be cultivated towards pleasant things also. Things pleasant and unpleasant are both in the domain of Maya, and the Self is beyond Maya, and so these lower modifications do not in any way affect the Self. The sthitaprajna having reached the Self-state is not at all concerned with them. The man of wisdom does not seek anything. And yet, nature brings many things to him, both pleasant and unpleasant in the course of his life. But he neither rejoices nor laments when these things happen of their own accord. He remains immovable like a mountain in a state of perfect equanimity. This is the mark of sthitaprajna. It should be understood that the Lord is not advocating a cowardly spirit desisting from the battlefield of life with all its duties, obligations, and responsibilities. Detachment is not neglect of duty. In fact, Arjuna was confused at first when he thought that he could attain peace by running away from the battlefield and taking up the life of a mendicant.The whole of the Gita is intended to emphasize that the challenge of life should be met with courage, equanimity, and knowledge of the real Self.Frustration may put on the garb of detachment. Cowardice may shine under the mask of renunciation. These are the common delusions of a weak mind. The Lord here insists that the good and the bad should be met without elation or depression. The sthitaprajna knows how to live life under all circumstances with mental equipoise and the joy of wisdom.",

      "When the yogi, like the tortoise drawing back its limbs into its own shell, withdraws all the senses from the sense objects, his wisdom is firmly fixed."
    ],
    "commentary": [
      "For self-realisation (Moksha) control of the senses is essential. When the senses are drawn back from contact with the sense – objects like sound, color, etc., then the intellect is rooted in Atma. The same truth is stated by Patanjali in the sutrasYogaschittavrittinirodhah, tadadrashtuh svarupe Avasthanum. These two sutras are affirmed by the verse. It means that the senses, which by their nature run after worldly objects should be drawn back, and the mind should be centered in Atma. When this is done firmly, and when there is no deviation from the Self, one’s knowledge becomes perfect.",
      "This idea is very clearly brought out by means of an illustration. The tortoise withdraws all its limbs into its own shell at the slightest apprehension of danger from outside. Even if the shell is hacked to pieces it would not extend its limbs. The yogi, like the tortoise, should drawback his senses from the objective world, and settle himself in the Self. It is not enough to restrain one of the senses from one set of objects. Of course, if one sense is controlled, it will make the control of the others easy. The yogi should withdraw all the senses from all the worldly objects. That is why the wordsarvasahis used. Even if all the doors are closed except one, through that one door dacoits may enter the house. Even if one window is kept open, a gust of wind from it may extinguish the lamp. So it is absolutely necessary that all the senses should be turned back, and there should be no contact with the external world. It is the sense-organs that make the person aware of the outside world. When they are drawn back there is no external world. In deep sleep, there is no external world because the senses are not functioning. Similarly, the yogi should stop the operation of the senses in his fully conscious state, and then the mind sees the Self within. Sense-restraint is thus the first and foremost of all spiritual disciplines.",
      "When a person learns to control or withdraw the senses from sense objects, as a tortoise retracts its limbs inside its shell in time of danger and cannot be forced to extend its limbs again until the trouble is over, the lamp of Self-knowledge becomes lighted, and one perceives the self-effulgent Supreme Being within. A Self-realized person enjoys the beauty of the world, keeping the senses under complete control like a tortoise. The best way to purify the senses and control them perfectly like a tortoise, is to engage them in the service of God at all times.",
      "“As the tortoise can draw in his legs, and if you strike him, not one foot comes out, even so the sage can draw all his sense-organs inside,” and nothing can force them out. Nothing can shake him, no temptation or anything. Let the universe tumble about him, it does not make one single ripple in his mind.[Source]",
      "As the tortoise tucks its feet and head inside the shell, and you may kill it and break it in pieces, and yet it will not come out, even so the character of that man who has control over his motives and organs is unchangeably established. He controls his own inner forces, and nothing can draw them out against his will. By this continuous reflex of good thoughts, good impressions moving over the surface of the mind, the tendency for doing good becomes strong, and as the result we feel able to control the indriyas (the sense-organs, the nerve-centres).[Source]",

      "An essential secret of spiritual realisation is revealed here.",
      "Restraining the senses is not alone enough. Direct perception of the Supreme is necessary. No doubt by restraining the senses, the objective world is repelled. But the taste for them remains in the form of subtle tendencies (vasanas) and unless these vasanas are removed steadiness of wisdom is not possible. Latent longing may rush forth when the restraint is relaxed. Even temporary causes like sickness and calamity may bring about a partial rejection of the sense world. But when these external causes pass away, the subtle vasanas break forth with all their original force. Hence the Lord declares thatonly when the Supreme is perceived, these vasanas are finally destroyed.The destruction of the vasanas, the destruction of the mind, and the direct experience of the self take place simultaneously. In the previousverse, it is said that by destroying the vasanas, Self-knowledge comes to man and in this verse, it is stated that self-knowledge destroys the vasanas. These are two aspects of the same Truth.",
      "Destruction of the vasanas is not an easy task. It is the only path to Moksha. If one achieves it, everything is achieved. The innumerable experiences of the past births have taken root in the mind in the form of powerful tendencies, attitudes, and propensities. They work through the senses, and the senses function by contact with the world. The material world provides the widest field of activity and food for the senses. The senses have been accustomed to browsing at will on these delicious pasture lands of material pleasures through many births. To deny them this form of food means restraining the senses and preventing them from contacting the objective world. But this does not solve the problem. The taste for the objects would still be there in the mind; whenever the opportunity arises, the mental tendencies spring forth to grasp the illusory pleasures because their taste is not dead. So the attempt at first is to withdraw the senses from the sense – objects (pratyahara) and next to destroy the taste for them concealed in seed-form in the mind. When the vasanas are destroyed, man attains freedom, and the objective world is then powerless to influence him. It is stated here that direct Self-knowledge alone is capable of destroying the vasanas.",
      "One must understand clearly the reality of Atma and the illusory nature of the world. One must hear of Atma often and often. He should think of Atma and contemplate on it frequently and intensely. He should know for certain that the world before his eyes is a painful illusion, that it is full of sorrow and suffering, that there is no permanent joy anywhere else except in Atma, and that Atma alone is the all-pervading substratum of the entire universe. As one thinks and acts on these fundamental truths, his attachment and craving for sense-pleasures become less and less and as they become weaker and weaker, the bliss of self is experienced more and more, till finally the bliss and blessedness of the Self swallow up the universe and converts it into its own element.",
      "Abstinent:Some interpret this as fasting. Here what is meant is not the abstinence of food, but the rejection of all sensory experiences.",
      "Then comes a very important question. Sometimes people fast for days. … When the worst man has fasted for twenty days, he becomes quite gentle. Fasting and torturing themselves have been practised by people all over the world. Krishna’s idea is that this is all nonsense. He says that the senses will for the moment recede from the man who tortures himself, but will emerge again with twenty times more [power]. … What should you do? The idea is to be natural — no asceticism. Go on, work, only mind that you are not attached. The will can never be fixed strongly in the man who has not learnt and practised the secret of non-attachment.[Source]",
      "Unless and until the mind is completely given to God, no external check can completely obliterate Lust.[Source]",

      "“Mere suppression of passions helps little. There must be a high ideal along with self-restraint.Without a high ideal, the passions will find another outlet. You must give them a new direction, then you will be automatically rid of them. “Take refuge in Me and control the senses.’ As for example, lust. Think that you are His child. Why should be so low you as to be lustful? Or think that you are ever pure.— Swami Turiyananda (Spiritual Talks: By the First Disciples of Sri Ramakrishna p.111&113)",
      "If you want to escape the results of good and bad karma, then chant God’s name, repeat your mantra, worship the Lord, and read the scriptures. Always discriminate between the real and the unreal.Good karma subdues bad karma, but cannot destroy it.

      "A man who has tasted even a drop of God’s ecstatic love looks on ‘woman and gold’ as most insignificant. One gradually obtains that love for God if one but prays to Him with a yearning heart and always chants His name and glories.— Sri Ramakrishna (Source: The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna)",
      "(To Mahima) “You explain ‘Aum’ with reference to ‘a’, ‘u’, and ‘m’ only.”MAHIMA:“‘A’, ‘u’, and ‘m’ mean creation, preservation, and destruction.”MASTER:“But I give the illustration of the sound of a gong: ‘tom’,3t—o—m. It is the merging of the Lila in the Nitya: the gross, the subtle, and the causal merge in the Great Cause; waking, dream, and deep sleep merge in Turiya. The striking of the gong is like the falling of a heavy weight into a big ocean. Waves begin to rise; the Relative rises from the Absolute; the causal, subtle, and gross bodies appear out of the Great Cause; from Turiya emerge the states of deep sleep, dream, and waking. These waves arising from the Great Ocean merge again in the Great Ocean. From the Absolute to the Relative, and from the Relative to the Absolute. Therefore I give the illustration of the gong’s sound, ‘tom’. I have clearly perceived all these things. It has been revealed to me that there exists an Ocean of Consciousness without limit. From It come all things of the relative plane, and in It they merge again. Millions of Brahmandas rise in that Chidakasa and merge in It again. All this has been revealed to me; I don’t know much about what your books say.”MAHIMA:“Those to whom such things were revealed did not write the scriptures. They were rapt in their own experiences; when would they write? One needs a somewhat calculating mind to write. Others learnt these things from the seers and wrote the books.”MASTER:“Worldly people ask why one does not get rid of attachment to ‘woman and gold’. That attachment disappears after the realisation of God. If a man once tastes the Bliss of Brahman, then his mind no longer runs after the enjoyment of sense pleasures or wealth or name and fame. It the moth once sees the light, it no longer goes into the darkness.“Some friends said to Ravana: ‘You have been assuming different forms4for Sita. Why don’t you go to her in the form of Rama?’ Ravana replied: ‘When I contemplate Rama, even the position of Brahma appears insignificant to me, not to speak of the company of another man’s wife! How could I take the form of Rama for such a purpose?’“All worship and spiritual discipline are directed to one end alone, namely, to get rid of worldly attachment. The more you meditate on God, the less you will be attached to the trifling things of the world. The more you love the Lotus Feet of God, the less you will crave the things of the world or pay heed to creature comforts. You will look on another man’s wife as your mother and regard your own wife as your companion in spiritual life. You will get rid of your bestial desires and acquire godly qualities. You will be totally unattached to the world. Though you may still have to live in the world, you will live as a jivanmukta. The disciples of Sri Chaitanya lived as householders in a spirit of detachment.“You may quote thousands of arguments from Vedanta philosophy to a true lover of God, and try to explain the world as a dream, but you cannot shake his devotion to God.5In spite of all your efforts he will come back to his devotion.“A man born with an element of Siva becomes a jnani; his mind is always inclined to the feeling that the world is unreal and Brahman alone is real. But when a man is born with an element of Vishnu he develops ecstatic love of God. That love can never be destroyed. It may wane a little now and then, when he indulges in philosophical reasoning, but it ultimately returns. to him increased a thousandfold.” (Source:Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna)",
      "Swami Adbhutananda related in his reminiscences how Sri Ramakrishna transformedKalipada’s life:",

      "Then the Master asked him, “What do you want?”",
      "Kalipada asked shamelessly, “Can you give me a little wine?”",
      "The Master smiled. “Yes, I can. But the wine I have is so intoxicating that you will not be able to bear it.”",
      "Kalipada took him literally and said: “Is it real British wine? Please give me a little to soak my throat.”",
      "“No, it is not British wine,” said the Master, still smiling. “It is completely homemade.This wine cannot be given to just anyone, for not everyone can stand it. If a person tastes this wine even once, British wine will seem insipid to him ever after.Are you ready to drink my wine instead of the other?”",
      "For a moment Kalipada was thoughtful, and then I heard him say, “Please give me that wine which will make me intoxicated my entire life.” The Master touched him, and Kalipada started to weep. We tried to calm him, but he went on weeping in spite of our attempts.",
      "On 23 December Sri Ramakrishna touched Kalipada’s chest and said, “May your inner spirit be awakened.” Then, stroking Kalipada’s chin, he said with great affection, “Whoever has sincerely called on God or performed his daily religious devotions will certainly come here.”The Master’s blessing and unrestrained love that day made Kalipada a new person. He gave up his drinking habit and lost all interest in worldly things.",

      "Even the learned man, well versed in the Sastras and vedic lore, is merely a play-thing under the power of the mind and the senses. The mind does not easily turn inwards. It is pushed out, as it were, and through the senses attaches itself to the objective world. If this is so in the case of a learned man who has understood the truth intellectually at least, what about the others? Similarly, the turbulent senses defeat and perplex the man who is trying his best to control them. The fate of the man who has not understood this principle can easily be imagined. The senses draw the mind and drive it in different directions. He is restless and distracted. He becomes utterly the slave of the uncontrollable senses. He who should have been the master is turned a slave! That is the unfortunate position in which many live and die.",
      "Even the pandits, the learned exponents of religion and philosophy, are carried off by the power of the senses and the attractions of the sense world.",
      "In the heart of every human being, the struggle between the real and the unreal, between good and evil, is taking place to some extent. As the man tries to get some divine force into himself in this struggle, Maya with all the regiments, spies, fifth columns, is increasing her own forces to neutralize the divine force which the seeker is gathering bit by bit. This verse describes an aspect of the struggle.The seeker should muster greater and greater divine strength by acquiring divine qualities, and then only can be hope to overpower the enemy.No one needs to be discouraged by the power of the senses. Indeed they are powerful. But what of it? The divinity within is far more powerful. If a pin is placed between two magnets the one which has the lesser power can do nothing. So is man placed between the sense world on the one side and the Divine on the other. The Divine is a far greater magnet and finally draws man to Himself. By control (sama and dama) practiced continuously, the necessary power is acquired by the seeker, and ultimately victory is his. No neglect of effort should be allowed to interrupt the practice. The same exhortation is to be found in the next verse.",
      "Learned:Mere book-learning is not enough. Spiritual experience is necessary.",
      "Perhaps, so far, people have under-estimated the strength of the enemy, and consequently, their effort has not been as intense as it should be. But now, the Lord has given us an idea of the hostile forces which one has to conquer. The first thing in a war is to know the full potency of the enemy forces, and only the defence and offence could be made with adequate strength and suitable strategy.",
      "The wise always keep vigilance over the mind. The mind can never be fully trusted. It can mislead even a wise striving seeker (Srimad Bhagavatam 5.6.2-5). One has to be very alert and closely witness the wanderings of the mind. Never relax your vigilance until the final goal of God-realization is reached.Sri Sarada Devi said:It is the very nature of the mind to go to lower objects of enjoyment, just as it is the nature of water to flow downwards. The grace of God can make the mind go towards higher objects, just as the sun’s rays lift the water to the sky.",
      "The human mind is ever ready to deceive and play tricks. Therefore, discipline, constant vigilance, and sincere spiritual practice are needed. The mind is like an unruly horse that needs to be broken in. Never let the mind roam unwatched into the realm of sensuality. The path of spiritual life is very slippery and has to be trodden very care­fully to avoid falls. It is not a joyous ferryboat ride, but a very diffi­cult path to tread like the sharp edge of a sword. Many obstacles, dis­tractions, and failures come on the path to help the devotee become stronger and more advanced on the path, just like iron is turned into steel by alternate heating, cooling, and hammering. One should not get discouraged by failures, but carry on with steadfast determination.",
      "2.Sri Suka said:What you say is true in a way. But though the mind has been controlled, it cannot be trusted too much. The best of Yogis do not do so, knowing its fickleness and untrustworthiness, just as a determined hunter would not trust a captured animal with any freedom.",

    "commentary": [
      "All the senses should be controlled not merely one or two. A pot with a single small hole cannot retain water. So sense-pleasures of any kind will lead to a downright fall from the spiritual aim. This is emphasized again and again by the Lord. That is why the word Sarvani (all) is used frequently verse after verse. In this verse, two practices are mentioned : (1) Control of the senses from running out and attaching themselves to sense objects, and (2) directing the mind towards the Supreme Lord (merging in Atma).It means rejection of the objective world (Drisya) and identification with the subject (Drik).Both practices are necessary. The first practice alone is not enough. In sleep, the senses do not function, and the objective world is not there. And yet there is no knowledge. So identification with the subject (Drik) is essential while rejecting the objective world (Drishya). It is not enough to clear debts; one should acquire some property. Then he is satisfied. Similarly let a man ceaselessly reject the sense-world as it appears and at the same time, let him think of himself as the pure and perfect Atma. Again, the second practice meditating on Atma is no doubt good, but without the first, the seeker is sure to fall off from the high aim.So the two practices should be undertaken simultaneously.",
      "Harmonized:With what ? not with the sense-world, but with the Self. It means one who is in a super-conscious state (Samadhi).",
      "With mind absorbed in Me:Lord Krishna is God Himself. So, when He speaks of Me, the Supreme Self is suggested. The Dualists contemplate the sublime and beautiful form of Lord Krishna and are entranced by it. They sing His name in a thousand ways, they find delight in his glory and the wonderful attributes of divinity in Him. Blessed are those devotees who have renounced the world and live in the Lord in an ecstasy of joy.",
      "The Advaitin makes no difference between the Lord and the Supreme Self. They are one and the same. This is the finest fruit of Vedanta, that there is only one indivisible existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute. In that state, God and the devotee become one. The Gita is the scripture both for the devotees-Bhaktas and the Jnanis. So the reader should interpret, these expressions correctly, and not fall into the error of accepting only one aspect of truth and rejecting the other.In this verse, the first line points out the practice, and the second line the result of the practice.The first line says that the seeker should control the senses and establish himself in Atma. The second line declares that such a man acquires firm knowledge of the Supreme.",
      "Without sense-control, the mind cannot be fixed in Atma. Even if one tries to do so, it is immediately drawn out by the distracting power of the senses. The energy acquired through meditation is frittered away by indulgence in sense-pleasures. The peasant may work hard all the day to water the field, but if there are rat-holes, all the water goes into them, and nothing remains to water the field. So, these rat-holes should be plugged first, and then the work of the peasant bears fruit. Even so, the rat-holes of sense-desires and sense-pleasures should be stopped first, so that whatever divine contemplation one may practice might gather strength gradually and lead to final illumination. Let the seekers understand the importance of sense-control for Self-realisation, and follow the practice with courage and determination.",

    ],
    "commentary": [
      "These two verses are of great importance for the spiritual aspirant. The gradual process of Self-destruction is traced here with psychological accuracy. The contemplation of sense objects is the first step in the downward process. The enemy enters the house in the guise of a friend, and gradually occupies the whole house, and pushes the owner out. There is an English Proverb – “Give me room to sit down, and I can make room to lie down.” Such is the power of Maya that from very small imperceptible beginnings, it grows almost to infinity.",
      "At first, the man may not have any particular attachment to anything, but gradually the senses prompted by past samskaras settle on a particular object and the mind begins to contemplate it. So a kind of contact is established between the mind and that object, the senses being the connecting link. The object may be anything from the fashionable piece of dress to the glamour and glory of an Emperor. That contact becomes stronger and stronger, and a deeply felt desire arises to possess and enjoy that object. This is Kama. It is the worst enemy of man.Mahapapam(all sinful) – such is the Lord’s description of Kama. When Kama enters the mind, it is like a reptile moving about in the house. The occupants of that house live in horrible dread and there is every danger of their being stung and killed. Such indeed is the destructive power of Kama when it enters the human heart. It is indeed better to stop it before it enters the mind. But if it enters stealthily, the moment one discovers it, he should throw it out with all the power at his command. Otherwise, the Kama in its wake will bring his associates, friends, and other destructive forces like Krodha and throw down the unfortunate man into destruction. All this is vividly described by the teacher of the Gita. Let the seeker know who his enemies are, how they work, how they tempt, how they subdue, and how they, finally destroy man.",
      "When Kama enters the mind, just behind him comes Krodha. These two are eternal associates of evil. One cannot be without the other. Such is the closeness of their intimacy. The frustration of desire causes anger and hatred. Krodha is like powerful alcohol. Passion like poison fills the whole personality. He trembles and shivers all over the body, the eyes become bloodshot, ‘speech, becomes incoherent, abuse and violence are indulged in, and the human being is transformed into a wild animal that is deprived of a piece of flesh when it is hungry. He behaves like a man possessed by an evil spirit. So it is said here that delusion (sammoha) over-powers him by anger (Krodha). Delusion causes loss of memory.",
      "The deluded man, fired with anger, forgets the people with whom he is dealing. Be he a father or Guru, or friend; the angry man abuses him and strikes him down. For the time being, he forgets the status of the person, honor for the father, reverence for the Guru, affection for the friend. This is loss of memory (smritivibramah) of one’s Self. So long as a man holds on to the Self, anger cannot overpower him. But the moment that memory of his true Self is lost, man becomes a beast.",
      "From the loss of memory, discrimination of right and wrong is lost. By the destruction of the grinding intellect, man perishes. Therefore the Lord warns the aspirant to keep himself away from sense objects, and practice self-control.",
      "Contemplating the objects of the senses:It is important to note that the word contemplation is used in this context. Contemplation is not a new faculty to be acquired. Every man is constantly in a state of contemplation. Some contemplate wealth, others the pleasure of wine, others the pleasures of sex, others the dignity of position, name, and fame. So the world moves on, each one attached to a particular desire, meditation on it, and trying to realise it as much as possible. So contemplation is the natural faculty of the mind. The wise man who has understood the worthlessness of worldly pleasures turns his mind to God and contemplates the purity and glory of God. He attains pure joy and endless peace.",
      "What is required is that the same power of contemplation that runs after worldly objects should be given a new direction towards a spiritual aim. We come across stories of men immersed in sensuality, suddenly turning out to be pure devotees of God. What happens in such cases is that the man, by some cause or other, discovers the filthy nature of sensual pleasures and turns away from them, and the mind naturally runs for the pure and perfect, with the same force and momentum as it formerly had for sense-pleasures. The point is contemplation should be directed towards Atma, and not towards sense objects. Prahlada asked the Lord for the same boon, that his mind may always be fixed in the Lord and not in the ephemeral world.",
      "The proud and covetous can never rest. The poor and humble in spirit live together in all peace.",
      "The man that is not yet perfectly dead to himself, is quickly tempted and overcome in small and trifling things.[Source]",
      "These blows must come upon us all. They are in the nature of things, yet they are so hard to bear. The force of association makes out of this unreal world a reality; and the longer the company, the more real seems the shadow. But the day comes when the unreal goes to the unreal, and ah, how sad to bear. Yet, that which is real, the Soul, is ever with us, omnipresent.Blessed is the person who has seen the real in this world of vanishing shadows.[Source]",
      "Tarak of Belgharia arrived with a friend and bowed low before Sri Ramakrishna, who was sitting on the small couch. The room was lighted by an oil lamp. A few devotees were sitting on the floor.Tarak was about twenty years old, and married. His parents did not allow him to come to Sri Ramakrishna. He lived mostly at his home near Bowbazar. The Master was very fond of him. Tarak’s friend had a tamasic nature; he rather scoffed at the Master and religious ideas in general.MASTER (to Tarak’s friend):“Why don’t you go and visit the temples?”FRIEND:“Oh, I’ve seen them before.”MASTER:“Is it wrong for Tarak to come here?”FRIEND:“You know best.”MASTER (pointing to M.):“He is a headmaster.”FRIEND:“Oh!”Sri Ramakrishna asked about Tarak’s health and talked with him at length. Tarak was ready to leave. Sri Ramakrishna asked him to be careful about many things.MASTER:“My good man, beware. Beware of ‘woman and gold’. Once you sink in the maya of a woman, you will not be able to rise. It is the whirlpool of the Visalakshi. (A stream near Kamarpukur) He who has fallen into it cannot pull himself out again. Come here now and then.” (Source:Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna)",

He may be using the senses and sense objects for the purpose of sustaining his life, but such work does not befoul the purity and peace of his mind. When the poisonous fangs are pulled out, the serpent is harmless. Similarly, when attraction and repulsion (Raga and Dwesha) are eliminated from the mind, the senses lose their evil power, and then they are only instruments in the hands of man to do what he wants them to do, or to remain quiet in their places. Such a man can move freely in the world and no harm comes to him. When the horses are well under control, the charioteer feels free and happy because they take him easily to the destination without trouble and danger. So the senses help and not hinder the man who has obtained control over the mind.",
      "Self-restrained, self-controlled:Self-control is the necessary condition for Self-realisation. Without it, spiritual life is not possible. The mind and the senses should be under one’s own control, and not he under their control. The deluded self of the common man consists of turbulent senses, sensual impulses of the mind, and animal instincts of hunger, fear, lust, etc. So man acts under the power and instigation of the mind and the senses. They have mastered him, and he is their slave. Man should regain his mastery over himself. Without self-mastery, no man can attain peace and happiness. He may have all the wealth and power in the world, he may have all the desires fulfilled, but the peace he cannot have becausepeace is the reward of self-mastery. It cannot be purchased with wealth and power. The Lord points out the way to peace. Control of the senses, purification of mind – these two conditions should be fulfilled first before man could experience the bliss of Atma.",
      "Question:Who can attain peace?",
      "Answer:He whose mind is free from attachment, whose senses are restrained, and whose mind is controlled attains peace."

      "Every individual is seeking for the elimination of sorrow, and the attainment of peace. How can he get them? The path is shown here. By purity and peace of mind, both are acquired. When the mind is freed from impure impulses the aim of spiritual life is achieved. Just as in a clean mirror the reflection is perfectly clear, even so in the purified mind the Self shines forth in its own splendor and glory.",
      "Sage Vasishta states that purity of mind arising from the deep knowledge of Atma is Moksha (liberation). So all those who desire Moksha should keep the mind pure by constant inquiry of the Self. Two great benefits are derived from the peace of mind – (1) Elimination of all sorrow and suffering, (2) Resting of the mind firmly in Atma.",
      "Of all sufferings:All sorrows and sufferings – (adhyatmika, adhibhautika, adhidaivika) -are removed at once when peace is attained. What a wonderful boon of peace for man! What more does a man want? A casual look at the world and humanity would reveal the horrid restlessness, distraction, and pain, both of the body and mind, which man is undergoing in this earthly life. Life is a fitful fever. Mad and delirious, man runs here and there, getting and spending, exhausting his energies, angry, distressed, and subject to the innumerable shocks of life. That is the unfortunate state of man. From all these evils man is protected by the contemplation of the Self and when peace is attained, these are completely eliminated. Peace is the condition of Moksha. If peace does not fill the whole being of man, Moksha remains only in intellectual concept without real meaning or substance in it.",
      "Mind is firmly fixed in Atma:When the mind is untroubled and peaceful the intellect is easily fixed in Atma. Then it is all bliss and blessedness. It is like a small river emptying itself into the ocean and becoming one with it. Even the happiness of the creator Brahma is only a drop in the ocean of the bliss of the Supreme Self. What more does a man want than to merge himself in the ocean of bliss? So let every man who is punished with sorrow and suffering by his own evil, know the path of liberation, and strive for peace."

      "Such balance and harmony are the immediate results of the purified mind. It has already been pointed out that a mind free from attraction and repulsion comes to be harmonized in yoga. So without purity, there is frequent mental agitation which makes it impossible for man to meditate on Alma. Through purity, mental harmony is acquired, through harmony the power of meditation is acquired, and through meditation peace, and through peace, happiness. The negative form of the ideas and interrogation at the end proves that the Lord wants to emphasize these ideas for the guidance of the seeker. Peace is an important step for self-realisation."

    "commentary": [
      "The seeker should have dispassion towards sense objects like color, sound, form, etc. If the senses are allowed freely to wander in the wilderness of the objective world, there is a great danger. The mind functions through the senses which are constantly in contact with material objects. The mind by its own impurities prompts the senses to seek enjoyment in the objective world. The mind follows the senses and is carried away in various ways. A simile is used to illustrate the idea. The gale carries away the ship on the waters. The ship may capsize by the gale or otherwise be damaged and lost. Likewise, the mind is driven away from Atma and wrecked on the rocks of sensual pleasures. Even a single sense-organ is capable of pulling away the mind from the spiritual goal. If all the senses rebel, what should be the fate of the man?",
      "Therefore the mind should be trained to think of the Self and to discriminate between the real and the unreal. If the mind is trained in this way, it can resist the temptation caused by the senses. Otherwise, the mind runs after the senses. The eye sees an attractive object and the mind thinks of it. The power of discrimination is lost. When the intellect yields to the glamour of the mind, man becomes a slave to the material world. So the seeker should carefully preserve his power of discrimination and spiritual attitude, by shutting out the objective world as much as possible. We come across instances of spiritual aspirants suddenly lapsing into sense-pleasures and ruining their chances of ultimate victory. By some amount of practice, they acquire a little steadiness of mind and experience a little peace, but then, by their own negligence, they allow the senses to touch some material object, and the whole process of degradation starts. The mind is like a rubber ball. If the ball is let down on the top of the staircase, it rolls down step by step till it falls on the ground. The seeker therefore should not relax his vigilance even for a moment till the final goal is reached.",

      "For the common man, the Self-state appears like night, because he can see nothing beyond the senses and the sense-world. What the common man calls day and wakefulness is simply the functioning of the senses in the material world. But it is not so for the yogi who is one with the light of Atma. For him, the senses and the sense-world are not there, but he is fully wakeful in his experience of the Self. So what is a night for the common man, is real wakefulness for the self-controlled. Similarly being awake only in the infinite light of Atma, seeing nothing of the objective world, the yogi finds night in the day when all beings are awake to the diversity of the objective world.",
      "For the Yogi who sees the Self, the objective world does not exist, and so it is night. For the common man who sees the world, the Self does not appear and so it is a night for him.",
      "So the experience of the sage and the common man are at the opposite poles. The man of knowledge knows that the objective world is like a dream, appearing to exist, but really non-existent. He is therefore utterly indifferent to the avocations of worldly life from day-to-day. He has developed intense dispassion and so the sense-world has no meaning for him. He does not recognize its existence. So sense-world is all night and sleep for him. But for the ignorant, the objective world is the only reality. To them, this is all. day and wakefulness.",
      "Self-Controlled:The aspirant who has perfected self-restraint is mentioned here as the one capable of perceiving the self, without the distractions of the sense-world.",
      "The sage who realises the Self:There may be many meditating on the Self, but only a few could have a direct vision. It is made quite clear that the direct experience of Brahman is the goal of all spiritual sadhana and the Muni obtains it by long and continuous absorption in Reality. But the total rejection of the sense-world can only open the vision of the Supreme. Again and again, the Lord reiterates the need for self-restraint and self-control.",
      "“Where it is dark night for the [sense-bound] world, the self-controlled [man] is awake. It is daylight for him. … And where the world is awake, the sage sleeps.” Where is the world awake? In the senses. People want to eat and drink and have children, and then they die a dog’s death. … They are always awake for the senses. Even their religion is just for that. They invent a God to help them, to give them more women, more money, more children — never a God to help them become more godlike! “Where the whole world is awake, the sage sleeps. But where the ignorant are asleep, there the sage keeps awake” — in the world of light where man looks upon himself not as a bird, not as an animal, not as a body, but as infinite spirit, deathless, immortal. There, where the ignorant are asleep, and do not have time, nor intellect, nor power to understand, there the sage is awake. That is daylight for him.[Source])",
      "“Where the world is awake, there the man of self-control is sleeping. Where the world sleeps, there he is waking.” May even the dust of the world never touch you, for, after all the poets may say, it is only a piece of carrion covered over with garlands. Touch it not — if you can.[Source]",
      "The end and aim of yoga is to realize God. To do this we must go beyond relative knowledge, go beyond the sense-world. The world is awake to the senses, the children of the Lord are asleep on that plane. The world is asleep to the Eternal, the children of the Lord are awake in that realm. These are the sons of God. There is but one way to control the senses — to see Him who is the Reality in the universe. Then and only then can we really conquer our senses.[Source]",
      "Question:What is the difference between the Self-Controlled and the common man?",
      "Answer:The common man lives and moves in the material world. The sage leaves behind the objective world and enters the subtle plane of the spirit and attains direct vision of the Truth."

      "The man who is moved by desires and pleasures cannot attain peace. He alone attains peace who has conquered all desires. The man of steady wisdom, the sthitaprajna is compared to the ocean. Though the waters of the ocean are drawn up by the sun in the form of clouds, it is not reduced in any way. So also, though rains and floods join the ocean, it does not expand. It remains the same, immovable. In the same way, the sage of steady wisdom remains unmoved, when all desires flow into him without producing any reactions of the mind or the body. All the enjoyments of the sense-world may come to him, but they are all absorbed in the blissful experience of the Self. He does not recognize them as anything other than the bliss of Self-realisation. He may be put in a palace surrounded by all earthy pleasures. And yet he is indifferent to them. He knows only one Reality one happiness, in which everything is dissolved as all the waters are absorbed by the ocean. Similarly, the sage may be placed on the most painful circumstances and yet he knows only one Reality and one happiness (Ananda). The pain also merges into the same reality and disappears.",
      "The Jnani has dispassion towards the pleasures of the material world. If there is the least trace of desire for this or that, he is still not a sage. The real Jnani is like the ocean, vast, and full. He is filled with the bliss of Brahmananda. And just as the ocean is full and immovable, the Jnani is firm, immovable, and changeless, in all the states and conditions of life. Small wells, tanks, and reservoirs are not like the ocean. When floods come, they overflow, cut the bund and cause damage. When there is drought, they dry up and look like empty pits. They change. But the ocean is changeless. The ignorant man is upset one way or the other by the pleasures and sufferings of life. They are distracted both when pleasures come, and when suffering falls to their lot.",
      "The ocean does not seek for augmenting its water from rains and rivers. They come and the ocean simply absorbs them. That is all. The Jnani also does not seek anything. When Providence brings pleasures, he absorbs them into his own Brahmananda and remains unaffected.",

Deign to accept them.’ They came to the palace, for now they always wanted money for one thing or another: the building of a house, the rice-taking ceremony of their babies, or the rituals connected with the beginning of their children’s education.",

That alarmed their teacher. ‘My disciples have acquired great spiritual powers’, thought Virabhadra. ‘Whatever they say to people will come to pass. Wherever they go they may create alarming situations; for people offending them unwittingly will come to grief.’ Thinking thus, Virabhadra one day called them to him and said, ‘See me after performing your daily devotions on the bank of the Ganges.’ These disciples had such a high spiritual nature that, while meditating, they would go into samadhi and be unaware of the river water flowing over their heads during the flood-tide. Then the ebb-tide would come and still they would remain absorbed in meditation.“Now, one hundred of these disciples had anticipated what their teacher would ask of them. Lest they should have to disobey his injunctions, they had quickly disappeared from the place before he summoned them. So they did not go to Virabhadra with the others. The remaining twelve hundred disciples went to the teacher after finishing their meditation. Virabhadra said to them: ‘These thirteen hundred nuns will serve you. I ask you to marry them.’ ‘As you please, revered sir’, they said. ‘But one hundred of us have gone away.’ Thenceforth each of these twelve hundred disciples had a wife. Consequently they all lost their spiritual power. Their austerities did not have their original fire. The company of woman robbed them of their spirituality because it destroyed their freedom.",
      "(To Vijay)“You yourself perceive how far you have gone down by being a servant of others. Again, one finds that people with many university degrees, scholars with their vast English education, accept service under their English masters and are daily trampled under their boots. The one cause of all this is woman. They have married and set up a ‘gay fair’ with their wives and children. Now they cannot go back, much as they would like to. Hence all these insults and humiliations, all this suffering from slavery.“Once a man realises God through intense dispassion, he is no longer attached to woman. Even if he must lead the life of a householder, he is free from fear of and attachment to woman. Suppose there are two magnets, one big and the other small. Which one will attract the iron? The big one, of course. Cod is the big magnet. Compared to Him, woman is a small one. What can ‘woman’ do?”",

    "commentary": [
      "The final goal of Vedanta is set forth here. All the practices – restraint of the senses, mind control, abandoning all ego-centric thoughts and feelings, having no consciousness of me and mine lead to the ultimate union of the individual being with the Supreme Self. The individual who thought of himself, as a separate entity now realises that he is no other than the Self, which is the Reality in himself and in all beings. This is the Brahmi-state. By constant meditation on the Self, the individual being becomes that, even as the worm becomes the bee by contemplating on it deeply and continuously. When the Brahmi-state is reached, all delusions cease, all doubts are cleared. The absolute Truth is realised.",
      "The Lord declares that the sage who has attained this state, will not be subject to delusion at any time thereafter.",
      "Even at the end of life:It does not mean that man attains the Brahmi-state in the last moments of his life. It means that he retains the supreme state even at the end of life. Such a man attains Moksha, the highest state of freedom and bliss. It is not possible to reach that state in the last moments of life if one had not struggled for it through a whole lifetime by performing sadhana. Even in old age, one should retain the memory of the supreme realisation. What is acquired by long practice should be kept fresh in the mind, even in the last moments of one’s life. The body and the mind are weak in old age. So the practice (sadhana) should begin when one is young and strong. The bad tendencies (samskaras) should be gradually eliminated. The mind should be purified and turned towards the Self, and constant meditation on the Self will lead to samadhi, and in samadhi, man realises his oneness with Brahman.",
      "The Lord declares that He should be remembered at all times, not simply at the time of death. Moreover, what one thinks of and practices during a whole lifetime would be in the mind at the last moments. So continuous practice is necessary. No one can say when the end may come. So uninterrupted sadhana should go on from day to day, even from childhood. Then it does not matter when the end comes. He will be ready to face it because he knows the Truth.",
      "So, instead of wasting time in foolish pursuits and vain endeavors, let the seeker start the sadhana at once and realise the Truth.",
      "Question:What is the Brahmi-state?",
      "Answer:Oneness with Brahman, acquired through the conquest of desires, self-control, meditation on Atma, is the Brahmi state.",
      "Question:When should a man possess this state?",
      "Answer:At all times, including the moments of death, man should retain this experience.",
      "Question:What will it lead to?",
      "Answer:The individual being attains Moksha, the state of supreme freedom and bliss."
