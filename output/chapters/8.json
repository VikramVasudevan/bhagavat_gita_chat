    "commentary": "Three questions are answered in this verse. First,what is Brahman?The Supreme and the imperishable is Brahman. Two attributes are mentioned here – supreme (Paramam) and imperishable (Aksharam). There is nothing other than or superior to Brahman. The One above and beyond which there is nothing else is Brahman. That is why it is described to be supreme Paramam. Brahman is imperishable, deathless. Since it is deathless it cannot be said to be born. The whole universe is constantly changing and going through the process of creation and dissolution in an endless chain. Birth and death is the law of nature, and there is only One that is birthless and deathless and that is Brahman. It is the seer (Drik), and so is indestructible. Destruction is only spoken of the seen (Drisya), and not of the seer (Drik). Brahman is indivisible, unaffected by time, space and causation.",

    "commentary": "As the Lord declares that He dwells in the body as Adhiyajna, He is most near to every being. The Lord is not far away either in the sky or in the underworld. He permeates the body with his invisible presence. So it is man’s duty to discover Him by close self-examination. As the Lord is very near to all, no one should be hated or looked down with contempt. The divinity of man is thus declared by the Lord.",

    "translation": "For whatever object a man thinks of at the final moment, when he leaves his body— that alone does he attain, Ο son of Kunti, being ever absorbed in the thought thereof.",
    "commentary": "Whatever a man thinks and contemplates frequently, becomes a tendency which holds the mind enslaved by ill-power and momentum. So it is said that whatever form or object the dying man thinks, he will obtain when he takes a new birth. Jadabharata in spite of his great tapas was attached to a fawn which he protected and when he passed away, the thought of the fawn filled his mind. Consequently, he was born as a deer. As one thinks so he becomes (Yadbhavam tadbhavati). This being the law, every thoughtful man should be extremely careful to choose and select only noble and spiritual thoughts to fill the mind. This should be practised throughout one’s life, so that they should be uppermost in the mind at the time of death. As all other things in the world are pain-causing, sorrow-breeding, the wise man naturally thinks of the Blessed Lord as the be-all and end-all of his life. Thus man attains the supreme state. Devotion, Dhyana, study, company of the wise, charity, all these should be practised truthfully and by so doing, divine thoughts permeate the mind and determine the future birth of man.",

They come and go in the same way as this world. But those who have attained Paramatma have no re-birth. This is Moksha. The reason is that all the worlds up to Brahmaloka are objective and so they repeat themselves endlessly. Only Atma which is the ‘Drik’ is not subject to the modifications of time and place.

Here the Lord gives an estimate of the duration of day and night of Brahma (Creator) and thereby suggests that even Brahma is limited by time. The day of Brahma is thousand yugas and night another thousand yugas. So one complete day and night for Brahma endures two thousand Mahayugas. The following table shows the duration in years:",

From the darkness of sleep stream forth the wonderful dream-world and all that dissolves in the darkness of sleep. The awakened man has nothing to do with the dream-world. So also Paramatma has no contact with the manifested which proceeds from and dissolves the unmanifested (avyakta). But he remains as a supporter of all.",

Thus birth and death go on repeatedly. Till knowledge dawns the cycle continues endlessly for the multitude of beings. As man is conditioned by his Karma, he is helpless to stop the wheel. As he is bound by his own desires, he is not free. Therefore man should strive for freedom. He has already passed through millions of births. By some good fortune, he has acquired a human birth. Without wasting it in useless pursuits, he should strive for liberation.",

There is no samsara again for the sage who attains the highest goal. Having lived in the world, it becomes clear that everything is vanishing like a dream. The child of today is the old man of tomorrow. Pleasures turn into pains. Joys lead to sorrow. Life ends in death. The whole scheme of existence is only a troubled dream. Time passes and death takes away all. Knowing this fully from experience the wise man is not at all interested in this child’s play. He has no relish for these insipid things. He knows that the dream life is utterly unbecoming of him, who has the eternal Self as his real Being. So he aims high, aims at Truth, aims at the lion rather than catch a jackal. So the Lord’s inspiring call to mankind is to give up the foolish little self, and ascend to him, and be one with him.",

So also, knowing clearly – this is Atma, that is Anatma, this is light and that is darkness, this is immortality and that is death – who will go into darkness and death? No. He would never allow delusion to come near him. He has understood the secret of life and death, by his discriminatory reason. Therefore the Lord says:- “O Arjuna! Be established in yoga; have your being always in the light of Brahman.” The Lord’s command is to hold the knowledge firm at all times because negligence even for a second would give way for Maya to work evil in the heart of man.",
