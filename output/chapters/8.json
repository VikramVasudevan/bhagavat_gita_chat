      "In the previousverse, the nature of the unmanifested (Prakriti) was explained.

The distinction between Paramatma and all other beings born of Prakriti is explained below.",
      "From this, we understand why we should worship the Lord. All that is non-eternal can only hold on to the eternal as its last refuge and support.

By such meditation, the death-stricken Jiva acquires immortality by union with That which does not perish.",

      "The Lord said: Brahman is supreme, imperishable. Its essential nature is called Adhyatma (Self-knowledge); the act of sacrifice that causes the birth of beings is named karma (action)."
    ],
    "commentary": [
      "Three questions are answered in this verse. First,what is Brahman?The Supreme and the imperishable is Brahman. Two attributes are mentioned here – supreme (Paramam) and imperishable (Aksharam). There is nothing other than or superior to Brahman. The One above and beyond which there is nothing else is Brahman. That is why it is described to be supreme Paramam. Brahman is imperishable, deathless. Since it is deathless it cannot be said to be born. The whole universe is constantly changing and going through the process of creation and dissolution in an endless chain. Birth and death is the law of nature, and there is only One that is birthless and deathless and that is Brahman. It is the seer (Drik), and so is indestructible. Destruction is only spoken of the seen (Drisya), and not of the seer (Drik). Brahman is indivisible, unaffected by time, space and causation.",
      "To the second question – ‘What is Adhyatma?‘- the answer given is nature (svabhava). One’s nature is svabhava (i.e.) the real Self of man, distinct from the superimposed body, mind, and senses. Out of ignorance, man thinks that he is the body and the mind, and that is his reall nature. It is an error. When knowledge dawns, one knows that he is the Self, Atma, uncontaminated by the body, mind, and the senses. So long as man identifies himself with the elements, which are subject to change and death, he cannot be happy. True happiness is only in the Self, pure, perfect, and imperishable.",
      "The third question is‘What is Karma?’The answer is ‘an act of sacrifice’, which is the cause of the birth of beings. This is yajna. By yajna, rains are produced and from rains, food, and from food all beings are born. The word ‘Visarga‘ here means that which is given away or that which is offered as a sacrifice to the Gods in the sacred Fire of the Yajna. In charity (Dana), wealth is sacrificed. Service to mankind in any form is an act of sacrifice. This also is Yajna, and it leads to Moksha.",
      "Question:What is Brahman?",
      "Answer:The indestructible and the supreme Being is Brahman.",
      "Question:What is Adhyatma?",
      "Answer:The true Self of man.",

The divinity of man is thus declared by the Lord.",

    "commentary": [
      "The Lord here explains how He is remembered by the self-controlled yogi at the time of death.",
      "Antakalecha:It is declared that whoever thinks of the Lord at the moment of death also, attains His being. The word ‘also‘ (‘cha‘) has to be carefully understood. ‘Cha‘ means ‘also’. The seeker has to think of the Lord not only during his life-time but at the moment of death also. The Lord did not say that He should be remembered ‘only’ at the time of death. That would be quite encouraging to all idlers and wicked men. Of course, even remembering the Lord at the time of death is also an act of merit. But such memory is impossible to retain at the moment of death, unless by long and steady practice, the mind is saturated with divine thoughts. Mostly people die thinking of their property, wife, or children because their minds were filled with those thoughts for a long life-time. So the Lord emphasises the idea of remembering Him at all time, both in life and in death.",
      "Those who have spent a whole life-time in spiritual sadhana can retain the memory of the Lord at the last moment. The exceptions are very rare. If a man wants to play some role in a drama, he goes through months of training, memorising his part. To pass an examination, a long period of preparation is necessary. It is within one’s own experience that what he thinks of intensely in the waking state comes up as a dream in sleep. In old age, at the moment of death, the functions of the body and mind will be at a low ebb and most people pass away in an unconscious state. So intense sadhana during a whole-time is essential for attaining the Lord by fixing the mind on Him at the time of death.",
      "The power of Maya is inscrutable. At any time it may overtake the person if he is negligent. So till the last breath, one has be vigilant. To sink in the ocean having come within a few yards of the shore or to fall off the ladder having touched  the last rung would be a disaster. Having kept away delusion for long, but yielding to it at the last moment is foolish. So the Lord exhorts all mankind to keep the light of knowledge bright till the moment of death.",
      "In the Yogavasishta, the sage Vasista advises Rama to be watchful and vigilant.",
      "Lust (Kama) easily devours the mind of the distracted man. But the demon can do nothing to the man whose mind is gathered up in Yoga.",
      "Me only:“Think of Me only” is the Lord’s command. Nothing can save man from the bonds of samsara except the one-pointed absorption in the Supreme Lord. If man wants peace and perfection let him seek refuge in the Lord only. He gives Moksha.",
      "The reward of devotion to the Lord at the last moment is that he attains union with the Lord. This is liberation, self-realisation, Moksha. He does not come again under the power of samsara. He reaches the Eternal. The Lord says, out of infinite compassion, “Have faith in Me I will save you from all the ills and perils of samsara.” So, having full faith in the Lord, and abandoning all small gains and profits in this or other worlds, let the seeker aim at the highest perfection and reach it by continuous devotion to the Lord.",
      "“The entangled creatures, attached to worldliness, talk only of worldly things in the hour of death. What will it avail such men if they outwardly repeat the name of God, take a bath in the Ganges, or visit sacred places? If they cherish within themselves attachment to the world, it must show up at the hour of death. While dying they rave nonsense. Perhaps they cry out in a delirium, ‘Turmeric powder! Seasoning! Bay-leaf!’ The singing parrot, when at ease, repeats the holy names of Radha and Krishna, but when it is seized by a cat it utters its own natural sound; it squawks, ‘Kaa! Kaa!’It is said in theGitathat whatever one thinks in the hour of death, one becomes in the after-life.(BG 8.5,BG 8.6) King Bharata gave up his body exclaiming, ‘Deer! Deer!’ and was born as a deer in his next life. But if a man dies thinking of God, then he attains God, and he does not have to come back to the life of this world.”A BRAHMO DEVOTEE:“Sir, suppose a man has thought of God at other times during his life, but at the time of his death forgets Him. Would he, on that account, come back to this world of sorrow and suffering? Why should it be so? He certainly thought of God some time during his life.”MASTER:“A man thinks of God, no doubt, but he has no faith in Him. Again and again he forgets God and becomes attached to the world. It is like giving the elephant a bath; afterwards he covers his body with mud and dirt again. ‘The mind is a mad elephant.’ But if you can make the elephant go into the stable immediately after bathing him, then he stays clean. Just so, if a man thinks of God in the hour of death, then his mind becomes pure and it gets no more opportunity to become attached to ‘woman and gold’.“Man has no faith in God. That is the reason he suffers so much. They say that when you plunge into the holy waters of the Ganges your sins perch on a tree on the bank. No sooner do you come out of the water after the bath than the sins jump back on your shoulders. (All laugh.)A man must prepare the way beforehand, so that he may think of God in the hour of death. The way lies through constant practice. If a man practises meditation on God, he will remember God even on the last day of his life.” (BG 8.7,BG 8.8)BRAHMO DEVOTEE:“You have spoken very beautifully, sir. Beautiful words, indeed.”MASTER:“Oh, this is just idle talk. But do you know my inner feeling? I am the machine and God is the Operator. I am the house and He is the Indweller. I am the engine and He is the Engineer. I am the chariot and He is the Charioteer. I move as He moves me; I do as He makes me do.” (Source:Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna)",

      "“According to theGita, one becomes afterwards what one thinks of at the time of death. King Bharata thought of his deer and became a deer in his next life.

    ],
    "commentary": [
      "Whatever a man thinks and contemplates frequently, becomes a tendency which holds the mind enslaved by ill-power and momentum. So it is said that whatever form or object the dying man thinks, he will obtain when he takes a new birth. Jadabharata in spite of his great tapas was attached to a fawn which he protected and when he passed away, the thought of the fawn filled his mind. Consequently, he was born as a deer. As one thinks so he becomes (Yadbhavam tadbhavati). This being the law, every thoughtful man should be extremely careful to choose and select only noble and spiritual thoughts to fill the mind. This should be practised throughout one’s life, so that they should be uppermost in the mind at the time of death. As all other things in the world are pain-causing, sorrow-breeding, the wise man naturally thinks of the Blessed Lord as the be-all and end-all of his life. Thus man attains the supreme state. Devotion, Dhyana, study, company of the wise, charity, all these should be practised truthfully and by so doing, divine thoughts permeate the mind and determine the future birth of man.",
      "That is why spirited sadhana is prescribed from childhood when the mind is pure and free from the poisonous ugliness of worldly life. Every man is himself responsible for his freedom or bondage. “If one thinks that he is free, free he is this moment. If he thinks he is bound, bound he should be.” Either high birth or low birth or freedom from birth and death, all these depend on man’s mental frame. And this frame of mind is forged by long practice throughout life. The good samskaras would re-assert themselves in the next birth and lead him to the goal.",
      "When a yogi makes a samyama (*) on his own karma, upon those impressions in his mind which are now working, and those which are just waiting to work, he knows exactly by those that are waiting when his body will fall. He knows when he will die, at what hour, even at what minute. The Hindus think very much of that knowledge or consciousness of the nearness of death, because it is taught in the Gita that the thoughts at the moment of departure are great powers in determining the next life.[Source]",
      "“Man becomes pure by repeating the name of God. Therefore one should practise the chanting of God’s name. I said toJadu Mallick‘s mother: ‘In the hour of death you will think only of worldly things—of family, children, executing the will, and so forth. The thought of God will not come to your mind. The way to remember God in the hour of death is to practise, now, the repetition of His name and the chanting of His glories. If one keeps up this practice, then in the hour of death one will repeat the name of God. When the cat pounces upon the bird, the bird only squawks and does not say, ‘Rama, Rama, Hare-Krishna’.",
      "“It is good to prepare for death. One should constantly think of God and chant His name in solitude during the last years of one’s life. If the elephant is put into the stable after its bath it is not soiled again by dirt and dust.” (Source:Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna)",

It is implied that unless a man thinks of Him always, he cannot retain that blissful memory at the time of death.",

The darkness of ignorance is ready to possess the heart of man if the lamp of knowledge is not kept burning continuously. It is only the thought of the Lord that keeps away delusion. When that thought is not there, delusion immediately seizes man. Therefore remember Me at all times – is the Lord’s command.",
      "Anusmara:Continuous thought of the Supreme should be kept up. Hearing of the Lord, thinking of Him, meditating on Him, the seeker should not let go his hold of the Lord at any time.

      "If all the time the seeker is thinking of the Lord, how can he get on in the world? When does he find timeto look after the practical duties of life? This question is asked by many people. Most people also make it an excuse that they are not able to think of God because of pressing domestic duties. To such people the Lord here gives the advice. “Think of Me and perform your duties.” Arjuna’s duty on the battle-field was to fight. For each man as he is placed in the various stations and circumstances of life, there will be particular duties and they should be performed while keeping the thought of the Lord in the mind.",

We don’t need any other spiritual discipline. Even Swami Vivekananda has said that by performing selfless service one can attain Mukti.” Revered Maharaj very firmly replied, “No.” I pointed out, “Swamiji has said that Karma Yoga leads to Mukti.” Then Maharaj asked, “Do you know what Karma Yoga is?” After a pause, he himself answered,“Conscious and constant remembrance of God while working.”This instruction is like a light house in our life.",

There are four fruits: dharma, artha, kama, and moksha. The jnanis seek the fruit of liberation; and the bhaktas, love of God, love without any motive behind it. They seek neither dharma nor artha nor kama.“You ask about the after-life. According to theGitayou will become in the next life what you think of in the hour of death. King Bharata was very much grieved over his pet deer; he died repeating the word ‘deer’; therefore he was reborn as a deer.That is why day and night a man should practise worship, japa, meditation, and other spiritual exercises. Only then, by virtue of practice, will he be able to think of God in the hour of death.(BG 8.5,BG 8.6,BG 8.7,BG 8.8) If one dies thus, thinking of God, one will acquire God’s nature.

Be alert about it.’“In Kamarpukur I have seen the women of carpenter families making flattened rice with a husking-machine. One woman kicks the end of the wooden beam, and another woman, while nursing her baby, turns the paddy in the mortar dug in the earth. The second woman is always alert’ lest the pestle of the machine should fall on her hand. With the other hand she fries the soaked paddy in a pan. Besides, she is talking with customers; she says: ‘You owe us so much money. Please pay it before you go.’ Likewise,do your different duties in the world, fixing your mind on God. But practice is necessary, and one should also be alert. Only in this way can one safeguard both — God and the world.“",

      "Engaged in the yoga of constant practice and not allowing the mind to wander away to anything else, he who meditates on the supreme, resplendent Purusha reaches Him, Ο son of Prithā."
    ],
    "commentary": [
      "In this verse, three definite practices are mentioned to reach the Supreme Lord.",
      "1. The Lord has elevated ‘practice’ (abhyasa) to the state of the yoga, like Karma yoga, Jnana yoga etc.No other yoga can bear fruit without being supported byabhysayoga.In the6th Discourse, the Lord has already referred to practice (‘Abhyasa’) as the primary method of controlling the mind.",
      "In the practical field of work, we understand the need for systematic practice. In sport and art, practice is essential for perfection. In fact, practice is nothing else than the repetition of the mode of thought or act. Any act repeated many times becomes a habit. All the bad habits have been the accumulated effect of wrong practice. If practice is done in the right direction, good thoughts and acts become natural and spontaneous. When one comes across a person who is pure in thought, word and deed, he admires him, and sometimes wonders how he could be so pure. But he should realise how he had laid the foundations of purity by long abhyasa yoga. All the impurities and weaknesses arising from previous births are overcome by the steadfast practice of goodness and purity in this life. Whatever may be the yoga that the seeker chooses to follow, it should be first and last combined with abhyasa yoga. Then alone it would yield good results, just as purifying powders work on the human body only when they are mixed with water.",
      "2. The second thing is that the man should not move away from the ideal. The aim is Atma, and the mind should therefore be centered in the Atma, and not allowed to move out towards material objects. Whatever appears (‘anatma’) perishes. Knowing this, through discrimination one should hold fast to Atma alone. As the mind by its nature can only hold on to some form it should be given some divine object or form to which it can easily cling to. So it is said here that one should meditate on the Supreme Divine Lord (Paramam Purusham Divyam).",
      "Anuchintayan:The Lord commands the disciple to think of Him (Atma) again and again, and yet again. So thinking continuously, man reaches the supreme state. Having full faith in the teaching of the Lord, may all the spiritual aspirants fulfil their life’s purpose.",
      "Question:What is the nature of Paramatma?",
      "Answer:He is Supreme, Self-effulgent, and Divine.",
      "Question:What is the way to reach Him?",
      "Answer:Restraining the mind from going out toward sense objects; remembering Him continuously is the way to reach Him.",
      "Question:How should the mind be restrained?",
      "Answer:It should remain steadfast in Atma alone, and not turn away from it."

    "commentary": [
      "The Lord describes the different aspects of Paramatma and points the way of meditation. It is necessary to know the attributes of the Supreme for strengthening and confirming one’s faith in Him.Naturally, people can only think of that about which something is known.So in the 9th verse, eight attributes of the Supreme are mentioned.",
      "Man when he leaves the body, should contemplate Paramatma by understanding Him through these eight attributes. Here death is described as travel to a distant place (Prayana). Just as man secures all necessary things before he starts on travel, even so he should provide himself with all the best qualities before he leaves the body.",
      "Thus during the last moments also man should contemplate Paramatma with Bhakti and Yoga. Both are essential for Dhyana. Bhakti is necessary to destroy egoism and secure the grace of God.

      "The Lord says that he would declare the Supreme briefly. The Supreme has no end as no words can fully describe it, so the Lord gives the very essence of the Vedas and the worship of the Supreme as the simple single syllable OM-Pranava.",

Knowledge of all other things cannot confer the bliss of immortality. In Hinduism, every child when he starts his education begins with the sacred word OM, which is Brahman. So whatever else a man may learn and understand, he should not neglect the knowledge of the Imperishable Brahman. The knowers of Vedas, after a great deal of thought, have arrived at the highest goal Brahman, and thus attained absolute peace and bliss.",
      "Who can enter this state? This question is also answered here. Only those who are free from attachment and desire, free from lust and hatred, can enter the Brahmi State. Let no man complain that he cannot attain that state. The key to this consummation is in his hands. It is purity. Let the mind be purged of all impure tendencies, and that very moment Brahman is realised.",
      "Those who practise severe austerities, restraining the senses and controlling the mind are qualified and fit to realise Brahman.",

The restraint should be complete and perfect. It should be understood that without sense-restraint, no other sadhana is possible.",
      "Already the Lord has declared “First restrain the senses.” As the tortoise withdraws – all its organs into its shell, so should the yogi withdraw all the senses from their usual external activities in the objective world.",
      "Then the mind should be centred in the heart, in Atma. The heart, Atma, is the source from which the mind arises. So the mind should be turned back to its own source. When the senses are controlled, the mind naturally loses its roving nature and sinks into its own source.",
      "The mind should think of Paramatma in a continuous stream of unbroken consciousness.",
      "What is the ‘mantra’ for meditation? The one-syllable OM, which is Brahman. OM is Pranava. It is the essence of the Vedas. It is not enough merely to utter the word OM but one should think of the Lord. It means that the idea symbolised by the word OM should be thought of. Mere verbal repetition of a ‘mantra’ without thinking of its meaning, will not yield the best results. If a cannon is filled with powder without the shell, it will cause a noisy explosion only, but the target is not reached because there is no shell. Similarly, when Pranava is uttered with its meaning in mind, it will lead to the goal. Ceaseless thought of the Lord is the way to Atmajnana.",

Is there such great need of your saying over and over again, ‘O God, You have created the sky, the great oceans, the lunar world, the solar world, and the stellar world’?“Everybody is wonder-struck at the mere sight of a rich man’s garden house. People become speechless at the sight of the trees, the flowers, the ponds, the drawing-room, the pictures. But alas, how few are they who seek the owner of all these! Only one or two inquire after him. He who seeks God with a longing heart can see Him, talk to Him as I am talking to you. Believe my words when I say that God can be seen. But ah! To whom am I saying these words? Who will believe me?“Can one find God in the sacred books? By reading the scriptures one may feel at the most that God exists. But God does not reveal Himself to a man unless he himself dives deep. Only after such a plunge, after the revelation of God through His grace, is one’s doubt destroyed. You may read scriptures by the thousands and recite thousands of texts; but unless you plunge into God with yearning of heart, you will not comprehend Him. By mere scholarship you may fool man, but not God.“Scriptures and books — what can one achieve with these alone? Nothing can be realised without His grace. Strive with a longing heart for His grace. Through His grace you will see Him and He will talk to you.”SUB-JUDGE:“Sir, does God show more grace to one than to another? If so, He can be accused of the fault of partiality.”MASTER:“What are you saying? Do you mean to say that the moon and a glow-worm are the same, though both give light? Iswar Vidyasagar asked me the same question. He said, ‘Is it a fact, sir, that God gives more power to one and less to another?’‘God’, I said, ‘exists in every being as the All-pervading Spirit. He is in the ant as well as in me. But there are different manifestations of His Power in different beings.If all are the same, then why have we come here to see you, attracted by your renown? Have you grown a pair of horns? Oh, no! It is not that. You have compassion; you have scholarship; there is a greater degree of these virtues in you than in others. That is the reason you are so well known.’ Don’t you see that there are men who, single-handed, can defeat a hundred persons? Again, one man takes to his heels in fear of another; you see such a person, too. If there are not different manifestations of power in different beings, then why did people respect Keshab Sen so much?“It is said in theGitathat if a man is respected and honoured by many, whether it be for his scholarship or his music or his oratory or anything else, then you may know for certain that he is endowed with aspecial divine power.“(BG 10.41)A BRAHMO (to the sub-judge): “Why don’t you accept what he says?”MASTER (sharply, to the Brahmo): “What sort of man are you?

When the truth is known there is no birth, and hence no pain or sorrow. The need for perfect freedom is stated here. Freedom is to be attained for the purpose of transcending pain and sorrow.",
      "The Lord makes it clear that the place where man takes birth is the abode of sorrow and is non-eternal. Birth is subject to those two evils. Even if a person feels that he is enjoying something here it is only a shadowy joy, which is mixed with pain. We see that joy is inevitably followed by sorrow as its own shadow. That is why wise men are not tempted by these reflected pleasures. The world is the abode of sorrow.  It is the place where sorrow rules. Out of ignorance and delusion, man imagines that he is enjoying this or that pleasure. But the Lord who knows the truth warns mankind out of infinite compassion – “O ye mortals, do not be deluded, this world is the very abode of pain and sorrow. Seek for that which is true joy and eternal and transcend all sorrow.",

      "Union with God is the highest state of freedom and perfection. As many enlightened sages have attained that state, it is suggested that every man can achieve it with adequate will and discrimination. Those who take refuge in God with a pure heart are mahatmas. Those who are entangled in worldly objects are ‘alpatmas,’ – little-minded men. Mahatma is a title. To reject the false and hold on to Truth, to reject the ephemeral and hold on to the Eternal, to reject anatma and hold on to Atma, is the way to attain the highest state of Mahatma.

      "In the universe, there are several places of existence-gross, subtle, yet more subtle, etc. All these do not touch the ultimate. They are all in the realm of the phenomenal the difference being in their gross or less gross nature. So those who reach the subtler worlds like Svargaloka or Brahmaloka have to return again. They come and go in the same way as this world. But those who have attained Paramatma have no re-birth. This is Moksha. The reason is that all the worlds up to Brahmaloka are objective and so they repeat themselves endlessly. Only Atma which is the ‘Drik’ is not subject to the modifications of time and place. It is imperishable. Having attained it there is no karma, and so there is no birth – Janma.",

Here the Lord gives an estimate of the duration of day and night of Brahma (Creator) and thereby suggests that even Brahma is limited by time.

Three hundred and sixty-five such days make a year, and one hundred such years constitute the life-time of Brahma.

The sage is not interested in anything by time, and the transitory pleasures derived by living in such worlds. He aspires to go beyond time, to realise the immeasurable Paramatma. Whereas everything is conditioned by time, the Lord alone is eternal. In Him, all time, space, and all the worlds are created by the power of His Mayasakti. The wise man takes no thought of the unreal but aspires for the Eternal. He knows what time is, and how time destroys all things, and how he can transcend time by taking refuge in Paramatma.",

      "All the Vedas and Sastras declare that Paramatma, the Imperishable, is the highest state. Reaching it man does not return to the perishable body. There is no samsara again for the sage who attains the highest goal. Having lived in the world, it becomes clear that everything is vanishing like a dream. The child of today is the old man of tomorrow. Pleasures turn into pains. Joys lead to sorrow. Life ends in death. The whole scheme of existence is only a troubled dream. Time passes and death takes away all. Knowing this fully from experience the wise man is not at all interested in this child’s play. He has no relish for these insipid things. He knows that the dream life is utterly unbecoming of him, who has the eternal Self as his real Being. So he aims high, aims at Truth, aims at the lion rather than catch a jackal. So the Lord’s inspiring call to mankind is to give up the foolish little self, and ascend to him, and be one with him.",
      "Reaching him, there is no re-birth. Why should man wish to be born in the cage of flesh? Is it to taste the ditch – water of several worldly pleasures again? Why does he crave for such wretched things when he is really the immortal bliss and blessedness. The man of Self-realisation rejects the body as a dirty tattered robe. He does not wish to wear it again. Immortality, bliss and blessedness, he enjoys when he attains the highest abode of the Lord.",
      "After Totāpuri left Dakshineswar the Master determined to return to the nirvikalpa plane. He did so, and as a matter of fact, remained in that state, more or less, for six months. It is a puzzling period of his life, in one sense, since he was cared for not by Hriday or other relatives, nor by Mathur, nor the Brāhmaṇī (all of whom were, apparently, still at Dakshineswar), but by an unknown wandering sādhu, a sojourner at the temple garden. This monk somehow knew that this body, with its matted hair, flies entering mouth and nose, looking more dead than alive, needed to be preserved for the world. Sometimes he would beat that body with a short stick, when, finding a little external consciousness, he would force food into the Master’s mouth.‘I was,’ says Ramakrishna, ‘in that state from which ordinary mortals never return.There was no consciousness at all of the coming of day and night. Calls of nature were perhaps answered unconsciously. Then after six months I heard the Mother’s command, “Remain in bhāvamukha for the spiritual enlightenment of men.”16 Twice before, he had heard this command (see Chap. II). Swami Saradananda devotes many pages to the explanation of this term. As we have said, it is a name for the general condition of a mystic’s mind which enables him on the one hand to experience the visions and ecstasies of the personal forms of God; and on the other, to leave the relative behind and plunge into the Absolute. This was to be Sri Ramakrishna’s condition for many years following. As already mentioned (in the Introduction) a devotee who saw him in 1874 testifies to his absorption in samādhi continuously for three days and nights. The Master said on many occasions, ‘The natural tendency of the mind is upwards, towards the nirvikalpa plane. Once in samādhi it does not feel inclined to come down. For your sake it has to be forced down. Even this is not motive enough, so I catch hold of trifling desires, and saying “I will have a smoke “, or “I will drink water”, or “I will eat this or that”, I thus force the mind gradually down to body-consciousness.’ (Source: The Visions of Sri Ramakrishna)",

    ],
    "commentary": [
      "It is declared here that these two paths of light and darkness, of liberation and bondage, of knowledge and ignorance, are eternal and fixed for all mankind. Those who acquire Atmajnana do not return again into the cage of flesh and blood. The others return again and again into the body, till they attain perfection. The two paths are open to man. Which to choose depends on the discrimination of man. If a man ascends into light, he is blessed; if a man descends into darkness, he suffers all the ills of human life. Let all the seekers resolutely, set their face against ignorance, and look upward for the Light of Atma.",
      "Question:What are the two paths open to the world?",
      "Answer:The path of light and knowledge (Uttarayana) and the path of darkness and ignorance (Dakshinayana).",
      "Question:What should the wise man do?",
      "Answer:He should eliminate ignorance and follow the path of light."

      "No yogi who understands these two paths is ever deluded. Therefore, Ο Arjuna, at all times be steadfast in yoga."

    "commentary": [
      "It is stated here that the yogi who understands the two paths of light and darkness is not deluded. It means that he would never go into darkness and delusion, but always ness is not de rest in the light of knowledge and truth. Having seen what is poison and what is nectar, the wise man rejects the poison and takes the nectar. So also, knowing clearly – this is Atma, that is Anatma, this is light and that is darkness, this is immortality and that is death – who will go into darkness and death? No. He would never allow delusion to come near him. He has understood the secret of life and death, by his discriminatory reason. Therefore the Lord says:- “O Arjuna! Be established in yoga; have your being always in the light of Brahman.” The Lord’s command is to hold the knowledge firm at all times because negligence even for a second would give way for Maya to work evil in the heart of man.",
      "The moment when the Lord is forgotten, that very moment causes danger, delusion, harm, and wrong action. The absence of light is darkness. Forgetfulness of Truth is itself the empire of Maya. The moment when man begins to enquire after truth, Maya disappears. When such enquiry lapses even for a moment, Maya enters, declaring ‘I am here’. When people pursue the thief determined to catch him, he runs away and disappears. Such is Maya. It is always in and around the people but when they pursue the enquiry after Truth, it disappears. So the enquiry should be kept up continuously. Man then lives in the light of Truth.",
      "Yogayukto bhava:Yoga means union with Paramatma, through knowledge, devotion, or dhyana or by any and every means pointed out in the Sastras. To be established in such yoga is what is taught here.",
      "Question:Who is not deluded?",
      "Answer:He who knows light and darkness, knowledge and ignorance, does not fall into error and delusion.",
      "Question:What is the duty of the aspirant?",
      "Answer:He should always be established in yoga.",
      "Question:Is it not enough to be in yoga for a short time?",
      "Answer:No. To forget light, to forget Truth, is to fall into darkness and untruth. So one should always be established in yoga."

      "This— The answers to the seven questions of Arjuna, given in the eighth chapter of the Gītā. One must not merely understand, but also follow, the teachings implied in the answers.",
      "The excellence of Brahmajnana is declared here. The knower of the Imperishable Brahman attains the highest state, far beyond any of the meritorious rewards springing from the study of the Vedas, the performance of sacrifices and austerities, and the offering of gifts. Brahman is the only Truth, and having reached it, man attains the Supreme state. tams the Supreme st",
      "It is true that several meritorious rewards come to man through the performance of sacrifices etc. But they are all in the realm of Maya; they have an end; they are not eternal. Therefore the yogi aspires to attain that state in which all the rewards of all the good works are comprehended and fulfilled. And that state is the realisation of Brahman, the only Reality.",
      "Brahmajnana transcends all the merits derived from the study of the Vedas, or sacrifices or other good works. Fifty is included in the hundred. So the person who attains the hundred includes the fifty and transcends it also. Brahmajnana is ‘mahapunya’. The lesser fruits of other meritorious deeds are included in it. Whereas all other rewards end in time, the yogi of brahmajnana lives in eternal bliss.",
      "There are many illiterate people who cannot study the Vedas. There are many people who are physically weak and so cannot perform austerities. There are poor people who cannot offer meritorious gifts. What shall be the fate of all these people? Is there no way of liberation for them? The Lord here declares that by the contemplation and understanding of Brahman, they shall attain the highest state, and obtain all the rewards of all the meritorious acts done by others. Purity of mind and heart, and purity in devotion are the only things needed. The study of the Vedas, tapas, and dhyana, if they are performed without attachment, purifies the heart of man enabling him to attain Brahmajnana.",
      "Brahmajnana is the highest state. The seekers, in the beginning, may undertake all the good works enjoined in the Sastras. But let them not stop there, for, the goal is Self-relisation, and no one should stop at any intermediate stage. With Brahmajnana the quest for the Supreme stops, and man is eternally satisfied.",
      "Question:What is his merit who understands the imperishable Brahman?",
      "Answer:He attains all the rewards of (1) Vedic study, (2) Sacrifices, (3) Austerities, and (4) Dana and transcends all these.",
      "Question:What is the nature of Brahman?",
      "Answer:It is the primeval cause of all and the highest state (Param sthanam).",
      "Question:What is the highest state?",
      "Answer:Paramatma.",
      "Question:What should a person do who aspires to attain the Highest?",
      "Answer:With a pure heart, he should take refuge in Paramatma. As by watering the roots of a tree, all the branches, fruits and flowers are watered, so also the man who attains Brahman, derives all the merits of all the good works done in the world."
