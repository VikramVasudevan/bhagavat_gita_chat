      "The Lord said: To you, free from malice and cavil, I shall declare this profoundest secret, knowledge with experience combined, which having known, you shall be freed from all evil."
    ],
    "commentary": [
      "The Lord now teaches the highest knowledge (Atmajnana) and the profoundest secret (rajaguhyam) combined with direct practical experience. The word ‘guhyatamam’ indicates that the knowledge is the highest secret, beyond which there is nothing else to be known. The teaching of Brahmajnana is usually done to those who are qualified to receive it, or even to hear of it. What is that quality which entitles a person to hear and understand Brahmatatvam? The Lord answers it here by stating that Arjuna is free from malice (asuya). He is pure in heart and has the four qualities mentioned in the Sastras (sadhana chatushtaya). So the Lord reveals the supreme knowledge. Those who are eager to receive the knowledge from a Guru should first of all examine themselves and know fully well whether they are established in virtue and self-control. Brahmajnana will never reveal itself in the impure heart, whatever other things one may possess, power or position. These things do not qualify anyone to understand the Truth. The pure soul knows the secret and attains Brahman.",
      "He who does not indulge in misrepresenting good to be bad, who commends even low forms of goodness in others, who does not delight in thinking of the evil in others in anasuya. Of all the host of bad qualities, envy is the leader. Like poisonous cancer, it permeates the whole mind, and pulls down the sadhaka from any merit which he might have acquired by austerity. Several aspirants have fallen on account of this evil. The Lord understands human nature so well that he fixes attention on that one evil which is the source of all other evils. He knows that the disciple is free from this evil, and so, he reveals the profoundest secret to him in perfect confidence. Every disciple should impress his Guru about the purity of the heart, and only then would the Guru teach the highest knowledge. The purer you are, the greater would be the confidence of the Guru in you. Such mutual understanding is necessary for transmitting Atmajnana.",
      "Jnanam Vignanasahitam:The wordjnanamstands for knowledge obtained by the study of the Sastras. This knowledge is indirect (paroksha). Vijnana means direct experience (aparoksha). When one hears of a country from a friend or reads of it in a book, his knowledge of the country is indirect (Paroksha) but when he visits the country and sees it for himself, his knowledge is direct (Aparoksha). Such is the difference between Jnana and Vijnana.",
      "What is the fruit of Vijnana? The Lord says he who knows the truth directly is freed from all evil. What is this evil? It is samsara – the cycle of birth and death, with all the ills and sorrows of one’s ignorant life. Whatever is anatma comes under the delusive power of Maya. It is transient, incomplete, insipid, and appears to exist without any reality in it. Atma alone issubha(without evil). It is deathless, birthless, ever blessed, and blissful. So every seeker should follow the teaching of the Lord and rise to the plane of Atma.",

      "It is the sovereign science, the sovereign mystery, and the supreme purifier. It is perceived by direct experience, it accords with dharma, it is easy to practise, and it is imperishable."
    ],
    "commentary": [
      "All other sciences cannot bestow peace and bliss on mankind. Worldly knowledge can only deal with material things which are perishable. The profound mystery of life and death and immortality can be understood only when Brahman is realised. All other things are ‘anatma’, ‘jada’, insentient. They are impure. Atma the self, Brahman alone is pure and perfect. So this knowledge which reveals the ultimate Truth is declared to be royal knowledge and royal secret.",
      "This royal knowledge is to be attained by direct intuition. Its fruit is direct and immediate. All other works take time to bear fruit. But Brahmajnana bears fruit at once and the sage of realisation becomes Brahman, is Brahman immediately.",
      "It is declared here that the practice of Brahmajnana is very easy. When the mind is purified by self-effort of all its impurities like raga and dvesha, tamas and rajas no further effort is needed for the realisation of Brahman, because Brahman is self-existent and self-luminous. There is no effort needed to realise the truth. So it is said in the sastras that Brahmajnana is easier than crushing the tender flowers or easier than ordinary respiration. This is not only very easy to practice but it is also the source of all Dharma, eternal, and imperishable.",
      "Question:What is the nature of Brahmajnana?",
      "Answer:It is royal knowledge, royal secret, pure, supreme realisation by intuition, righteous, very easy to practice, and imperishable."

    "commentary": [
      "Whether in worldly or spiritual life, faith and devotion to an ideal is the key to success. The degree of success depends on the intensity of one’s faith. Man becomes that which he aims at, the time taken depending on the intensity of the effort, and the strength of the obstructing forces. Sooner or later, it is certain that man achieves what he yearns for with single-minded devotion.",
      "The Lord declares here that without faith no one could attain Him, and without attaining Him no one can get immortality. Let the seekers understand that much diligence is needed even in small things and common affairs of life. This being so, one can understand what care and caution are needed to realise the highest state. So, the Lord emphasises the efficacy of faith throughout His teaching.",
      "According to the Lord, this Samsara is a world of death. Death is stalking everywhere and yet blinded by the veil of avidya, man imagines that life is beautiful and pleasant. He has missed the true end of life. He has bartered away his birthright of immortality and eternal bliss to a mess of pottage. The Lord knows this, and out of compassion, he warns mankind not to come under the shadow of death and destruction. Without understanding the Truth, whatever other enjoyments man may try to have, all these are only the decoration of a corpse. The wise shall strive to know the Lord and transcend the ills of life and death.",

      "Paramatma is inconceivable by the senses and the mind. Even the elemental ether is not visible to the senses. How then can the chidakasa, the intelligence – consciousness (God) be an object of sense-perception? Just as the material world is pervaded by the elemental ether, even so by that supreme intelligence (chit) all beings are pervaded. So the whole universe is in Paramatma.",
      "The Lord is not placed in the world, because when closely examined, the world has no existence like the snake which is superimposed on the rope. How can paramatma, the reality, exist in that unreality – the so-called world as we see it? So, it is said that all beings are in Atma (the Lord) and He is not in them.",
      "As the Lord pervades all beings, material and mental the seeker should cognise His existence everywhere. He should not do evil deeds, should have love for all, and devotion to the Supreme.",
      "Ishan intended to retire to a solitary place and practise a special discipline of the Gayatri, through which Brahman is invoked. But the Master said that the Knowledge of Brahman was not possible without the complete destruction of worldliness. Further, he said that it was impossible for a man totally to withdraw his mind from the objects of the senses in the Kaliyuga, when his life was dependent on food. That is why the Master discouraged people from attempting the Vedic worship of Brahman and asked them to worship Sakti, the Divine Mother, who is identical with Brahman.",
      "MASTER (to Ishan):“Why do you waste your time simply repeating ‘Neti, neti’? Nothing whatsoever can be specified about Brahman, except that It exists.",
      "“Whatever we see or think about is the manifestation of the glory of the Primordial Energy, the Primal Consciousness. Creation, preservation, and destruction, living beings and the universe, and further, meditation and the meditator, bhakti and prema — all these are manifestations of the glory of that Power.",
      "“But Brahman is identical with Its Power. On returning from Ceylon, Hanuman praised Rama, saying: ‘O Rama, You are the Supreme Brahman, and Sita is Your Sakti. You and She are identical.’ Brahman and Sakti are like the snake and its wriggling motion. Thinking of the snake, one must think of its wriggling motion, and thinking of its wriggling motion, one must think of the snake. Or they are like milk and its whiteness. Thinking of milk, one has to think of its colour, that is, whiteness, and thinking of the whiteness of milk, one has to think of milk itself. Or they are like water and its wetness. Thinking of water, one has to think of its wetness, and thinking of the wetness of water, one has to think of water.",
      "“This Primal Power, Mahamaya, has covered Brahman. As soon as the covering is withdrawn, one realises: ‘I am what I was before’, ‘I am Thou; Thou art I’.",
      "“As long as that covering remains, the Vedantic formula ‘I am He’, that is, man is the Supreme Brahman, does not rightly apply.The wave is part of the water, but the water is not part of the wave.As long as that covering remains, one should call on God as Mother. Addressing God, the devotee should say, ‘Thou art the Mother and I am Thy child; Thou art the Master and I am Thy servant.’ It is good to have the attitude of the servant toward the master. From this relationship of master and servant spring up other attitudes: the attitude of serene love for God, the attitude of friend toward friend, and so forth. When the master loves his servant, he may say to him, ‘Come, sit by my side; there is no difference between you and me.’ But if the servant comes forward of his own will to sit by the master, will not the master be angry?",
      "“God’s play on earth as an Incarnation is the manifestation of the glory of the Chitsakti, the Divine Power. That which is Brahman is also Rama, Krishna, and Siva.”",
      "ISHAN:“Yes, sir. Both Hari and Hara are derived from the same root. The difference lies only in the pratyaya.”",
      "MASTER:“Yes, there is only One without a second. The Vedas speak-of It as ‘Om Satchidananda Brahma’, the Puranas as ‘Om Satchidananda Krishna’, and the Tantra as ‘Om Satchidananda Siva’.",
      "“The Chitsakti, as Mahamaya, has deluded all with ignorance. It is said in the Adhyatma Ramayana that when the rishis saw Rama, they prayed to Him in these words only: ‘O Rama, please do not delude us with Your world-bewitching maya.'” (Source:Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna)",
      "—–",
      "MASTER:“Pray to God. He is full of compassion. Will He not listen to the words of His devotee? He is the Kalpataru. You will get whatever you desire from Him.”PUNDIT:“I haven’t thought deeply about these things before. But now I understand.”MASTER:“God keeps a little of ‘I’ in His devotee even after giving him the Knowledge of Brahman. That ‘I’ is the ‘I of the devotee’, the ‘I of the jnani’. Through that ‘I’ the devotee enjoys the infinite play of God.“The pestle7was almost worn out with rubbing. Only a little was left. That fell into the underbrush and brought about the destruction of the lunar race, the race of the Yadus. The vijnani retains the ‘I of the devotee’, the ‘I of the jnani’, in order to taste the Bliss of God and teach people.“The rishis of old had timid natures. They were easily frightened. Do you know their attitude? It was this: ‘Let me somehow get my own salvation; who cares for others?’ A hollow piece of drift-wood somehow manages to float; but it sinks if even a bird sits on it. But Narada and sages of his kind are like a huge log that not only can float across to the other shore but can carry many animals and other creatures as well. A steamship itself crosses the ocean and also carries people across.",
      "“Teachers like Narada belong to the class of the vijnani. They were much more courageous than the other rishis. They are like an expert satrancha-player. You must have noticed how he shouts, as he throws the dice: “What do I want? Six? No, five! Here is five!’ And every time he throws the dice he gets the number he wants. He is such a clever player! And while playing he even twirls his moustaches.“A mere jnani trembles with fear. He is like an amateur satrancha-player; He is anxious to move his pieces somehow to the safety zone, where they won’t be overtaken by his opponent. But a vijnani isn’t afraid of anything. He has realised both aspects of God: Personal and Impersonal. He has talked with God. He has enjoyed the Bliss of God.“It is a joy to merge the mind in the Indivisible Brahman through contemplation. And it is also a joy to keep the mind on the Lila, the Relative, without dissolving it in the Absolute.“A mere jnani is a monotonous person. He always analyses, saying: ‘It is not this, not this. The world is like a dream.’ But I have ‘raised both my hands’. Therefore I accept everything.",
      "“Listen to a story. Once a woman went to see her weaver friend. The weaver, who had been spinning different kinds of silk thread, was very happy to see her friend and said to her: ‘Friend, I can’t tell you how happy I am to see you. Let me get you some refreshments.’ She left the room. The woman looked at the threads of different colours and was tempted. She hid a bundle of thread under one arm. The weaver returned presently with the refreshments and began to feed her guest with great enthusiasm. But, looking at the thread, she realised that her friend had taken a bundle. Hitting upon a plan to get it back, she said: ‘Friend, it is so long since I have seen you. This is a day of great joy for me. I feel very much like asking you to dance with me.’ The friend said, ‘Sister, I am feeling very happy too.’ So the two friends began to dance together. When the weaver saw that her friend danced without raising her hands, she said: ‘Friend, let us dance with both hands raised. This is a day of great joy.’ But the guest pressed one arm to her side and danced raising only the other. The weaver said: ‘How is this, friend? Why should you dance, with only one hand raised? Dance with me raising both hands. Look at me. See how I dance with both hands raised.’ But the guest still pressed one arm to her side. She danced with the other hand raised and said with a smile, ‘This is all I know of dancing.'”The Master continued:“I don’t press my arm to my side. Both my hands are free. I am not afraid of anything. I accept both the Nitya and the Lila, both the Absolute and the Relative.",
      "“I said to Keshab Sen that he would not be able to realise God without renouncing the ego. He said, ‘Sir, in that case I should not be able to keep my organization together.’ Thereupon I said to him: ‘I am asking you to give up the “unripe ego”, the “wicked ego”. But there is no harm in the “ripe ego”, the “child ego”, the “servant ego”, the “ego of Knowledge”.’“The worldly man’s ego, the ‘ignorant ego’, the ‘unripe ego’, is like a thick stick. It divides, as it were, the water of the Ocean of Satchidananda. But the ‘servant ego’, the ‘child ego’, the ‘ego of Knowledge’, is like a line on the water. One clearly sees that there is only one expanse of water. The dividing line makes it appear that the water has two parts, but one clearly sees that in reality there is only one expanse of water.“Sankaracharya kept the ‘ego of Knowledge’ in order to teach people. God keeps in many people the ‘ego of a jnani’ or the ‘ego of a bhakta’ even after they have attained Brahmajnana. Hanuman, after realizing God in both His Personal and His Impersonal aspect, cherished toward God the attitude of a servant, a devotee. He said to Rama: ‘O Rama, sometimes I think that You are the whole and I am a part of You. Sometimes I think that You are the Master and I am Your servant. And sometimes, Rama, when I contemplate the Absolute, I see that I am You and You are I.’“Yasoda became grief-stricken at being separated from Krishna, and called on Radha. Radha saw Yasoda’s suffering and revealed herself to her as the divine Sakti, which was her real nature. She said to Yasoda: ‘Krishna is Chidatma, Absolute Consciousness, and I am Chitsakti, the Primal Power. Ask a boon of Me.’ Yasoda said: ‘I don’t want Brahmajnana. Please grant me only this; that I may see the form of Gopala in my meditation; that I may always have the company of Krishna’s devotees; that I may always serve the devotees of God; that I may always chant God’s name and glories.’“Once the gopis felt a great desire to see the forms of the Lord. So Krishna asked them to dive into the water of the Jamuna. No sooner did they dive into the water than they all arrived at Vaikuntha. There they saw the form of the Lord endowed with His six celestial splendours. But they did not like it. They said to Krishna: ‘We want to see Gopala and serve Him. Please grant us that boon alone. We don’t want anything else.’“Before His departure for Mathura, Krishna wanted to give the Knowledge of Brahman to the gopis. He said to them:‘I dwell both inside and outside all beings. Why should you see only one form of Mine?’(Source:Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna)",

    "commentary": [
      "There appears to be an apparent contradiction. In the previousverse, it was declared that all beings are in the Lord. Here it is stated that the beings also are not in Him. The contradiction is only apparent and not real. From the point of view of the ignorant, the world has an existence, as it is touched and confirmed by the senses. So it is said to exist in, and sustained by Paramatma. From the Advaitic plane, the world does not exist at all, in the same manner as water does not exist in the mirage. So it is said here that the beings also do not exist in Him. This is from the pure Advaitic point of view, where there is only one undifferentiated eternal Brahman, and nothing else. The Lord’s declaration means that Drisya the seen world does not exist in Him, or He in Drisya. The man who has awakended from the dream comes to know that he never existed in the dream nor the dream in him. It is nothing. The man who saw the snake in the rope, when he comes to know the form of the rope, knows that snake did not and does not exist. Thus, there are no beings in the Lord, nor He in them. What existed, exists, and shall exist is Paramatma alone. This is the sovereign yoga of the Lord. The cosmic illusion appears to exist but really does not exist. So the world while appearing to exist, does not exist. All this is Brahman and nothing else. This is the royal secret.",

      "The Lord gives a beautiful simile to explain what He has said in the previous two verses. Just as the mighty wind rests in the ether which has no contact with the wind, so also all beings rest in Brahman, who is not contaminated by them at all. The objects cannot produce any effect on Him. The mighty wind rests in some part of the elemental ether. So also, the whole universe is in some spot in the supreme Brahman. The wind may carry good or foul smell, may be gentle or strong, but ether is not affected by it. So also, the good and bad in man or the actions taking place in the world do not effect Brahman. Ether cannot be seen, so also Paramatma; ether is subtle, Paramatma is more subtle; ether pervades all, so also, Paramatma pervades all beings. This illustration of ether and the wind resting in it is intended for the understanding of the common people only. In fact, ether cannot be compared to Paramatma, because ether is insentient and Paramatma on the other hand is supreme consciousness.",
      "The immediate and direct presence of Paramatma is to be realised everywhere and in everything. He is in every particle of the universe. Knowing this, can a man commit sin? Paramatma is the eternal witness of all. The supremacy of Paramatma is clearly to be understood because in Him is the whole of this wonderful universe.

Maha-Kali and Nitya-Kali are mentioned in the Tantra philosophy. When there were neither the creation, nor the sun, the moon, the planets, and the earth, and when darkness was enveloped in darkness, then the Mother, the Formless One, Maha-Kali, the Great Power, was one with Maha-Kala, the Absolute.…. “After the destruction of the universe, at the end of a great cycle, the Divine Mother garners the seeds for the next creation: She is like the elderly mistress of the house, who has a hotchpotch-pot in which she keeps different articles for household use. (All laugh.)“Oh, yes! Housewives have pots like that, where they keep ‘sea-foam’, (The Master perhaps referred to the cuttlefish bone found on the seashore. The popular belief is that it is hardened sea-foam.) blue pills, small bundles of seeds of cucumber, pumpkin, and gourd, and so on. They take them out when they want them.In the same way, after the destruction of the universe, my Divine Mother, the Embodiment of Brahman, gathers together the seeds for the next creation. After the creation the Primal Power dwells in the universe itself. She brings forth this phenomenal world and then pervades it. In the Vedas creation is likened to the spider and its web. The spider brings the web out of itself and then remains in it. God is the container of the universe and also what is contained in it.(Source:Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna)",

The magnet has no particular agency in this. It is just where it is. This Paramatma is in the universe like an unconcerned entity Udasina. But His immediate proximity enables Prakriti to create things. The word adhyakshena is used here to indicate the non-attachment and the consciousness – Principle of the Lord. An assembly, so to say, has no life till the president takes the chair. A Court, so to say, has no life till the judge takes his seat. When he takes the seat, the whole assembly is animated with life and goes into action. So also, Prakriti remains inert till it is animated by the presence of the Lord and brings forth the whole universe. Without Him, the universe would simply be inert matter and nothing more.",

      "The material world is inert. It has no life or activity by itself. What gives life to it is the Supreme Consciousness – Principle of the Lord Himself. This is not visible to the gross vision. It is the eye of Knowledge that sees it. That is Paramatma. The whole world is super-imposed on the Lord who is the basic adhishtana (support). What is super-imposed (aropitam) cannot be different from the original (adhishtana). All the powers that we see exhibited in the universe are derived from the Lord. And yet the Lord is in no way concerned with or affected by the actions of people in the world. The physical and the mental forces are only the grosser manifestation of the Atmic power of the Lord, which is the one power from which all others are produced by Prakriti. The wise man should not be deceived or destroyed by the temptations of the little force or power that he may have in him. He should know that, small or great, the power is the Lord’s and not his own. All the various forms of Cosmic energy, such as matter, thought, force, intelligence and so forth, are simply the manifestation of the Cosmic intelligence the Supreme Lord.",

As the saints and sadhus are devoid of worldly goods like wealth and position, some people show no respect for them. The Bhakta and Bhagavan are one. The Lord is present in His devotees and they have to be honoured as such. Sisupala and Duryodhana never understood the Divine nature of Lord Krishna. It was only Bhishma and a few others who recognised the Divinity of Krishna.",

In such situations, the seeker has to be firm and steady, and not yield to the common reactions of elation and anger.

To establish virtue, to destroy evil, to save the good I come from yuga (age) to yuga.” “Fools deride Me who have assumed the human form, without knowing My real nature as the Lord of the universe.” Such is Shri Krishna’s declaration in the Gita on Incarnation. “When a huge tidal wave comes,” says Bhagavan Shri Ramakrishna, “all the little brooks and ditches become full to the brim without any effort or consciousness on their own part; so when an Incarnation comes, a tidal wave of spirituality breaks upon the world, and people feel spirituality almost full in the air.”[Source]",
      "He also says, “Fools, not knowing that I, the Omnipotent and Omnipresent God of the universe, have taken this human form, deride Me and think that cannot be.” Their minds have been clouded with demoniacal ignorance, so they cannot see in Him the Lord of the universe. These great Incarnations of God are to be worshipped. Not only so, they alone can be worshipped; and on the days of their birth, and on the days when they went out of this world, we ought to pay more particular reverence to them. In worshipping Christ I would rather worship Him just as He desires; on the day of His birth I would rather worship him by fasting than by feasting — by praying. When these are thought of, these great ones, they manifest themselves in our souls, and they make us like unto them. Our whole nature changes, and we become like them.[Source]",

These vows should be followed with cheerfulness, courage and determination. Otherwise, progress on the spiritual path is obstructed and the seekers are drawn away from the goal by the force of ignorance (avidya). Firm vows are strong weapons with which avidya could be defeated and overcome.",
      "Nitya yuktah:They are always attached to the Lord, with devotion. Their worship is illumined by devotion. It is noteworthy how the Lord emphasises devotion to Him at every step. It is merely intellectual understanding but deep emotional realisation which leads to the Lord. Patanjali says :",

      "It is declared here that men worship Him in various ways, some as one Reality, identifying themselves with the One, others making a distinction between the Lord and themselves, and yet others in manifold forms. All these seekers finally reach the goal through different paths. The point to note is that the manner of worship may take any form provided that it is done with complete and immovable faith.",
      "What is jnanayajna?",
      "‘Brahman is real, the world is illusion. The Jiva is Brahman and not distinct.’ This – knowledge is jnana. To hold on to this is knowledge sacrifice (Jnana Yajna). This is the Advaitic realisation. This is ‘tat tvam asi‘ thought. This is ‘so ham‘ experience. When Lord Krishna completes the Gita Sastra, He declares that he who studies and tries to understand the spirit of the Gita is said to have worshipped the Lord through Knowledge-sacrifice (18-70). All people whatever their attitudes and styles of worship may be, shall have to understand at last that there is only One Reality and that Reality is nothing other than his own Self. This is the only way to liberation and this is jnanayajna.",
      "Viswatomukham:The Lord is universal, existing, everywhere and in each and everything. He is Paramatma and there is nothing else but He in all that one sees and experiences in all the worlds.

But this also I say to them: “Never feel that your path alone is right and that the paths of others are wrong and full of errors.’ Hindus, Mussalmans, and Christians are going to the same destination by different paths. A man can realise God by following his own path if his prayer is sincere. (Source:Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna)",

      "The thinker of this philosophy has been struck by the idea that one power is behind all phenomena. In our thought of God, there is human limitation, personality: with Shakti comes the idea of One Universal Power. “I stretch the bow of Rudra when He desires to kill”, says Shakti. The Upanishads did not develop this thought; for Vedanta does not care for the God-idea. But in the Gita comes the significant saying to Arjuna, “I am the real, and I am the unreal. I bring good, and I bring evil.”[Source]",
      "The very idea ‘I am the body’ is itself a misapprehension. It is the sole cause of birth, death, decay, disease… all of it. Hence the only way to be free of these is to be free of the body-identity; that can happen only through the right knowledge. There is a verse in the Bhagavata which says, “The Lord has two forms. When we open our senses and behold the world, the Lord is before us as the all-devouring time.” We can worship Him as such. Worshipping kāla is saṃsāra. This is what everyone does, and the fruit of such worship is death. The Bhagavata continues, “The same Lord is within you as Consciousness, as Purusha. If you turn your mind inward and realise Him in your heart, the fruit is immortality—amṛtatva. The same Lord, on the one side, is death, and on the other side, immortality.”* That is why in the Gita itself, Krishna says, “amṛtaṃ caiva mṛtyuśca—I am both immortality and death” (BG9.19).

      "The Lord here describes the attitude of some aspirants who seek the pleasures of Heaven by performing sacrifices. They are learned men who have studied the Vedas; they are purified by sacrifices; but they are attached to sense-pleasures, and so they desire for the finer and subtler enjoyments of the Gods. Their prayer is for heavenly joys. And they get them by the merit of their Yajnas. They are evolved beings no doubt, but they are imperfect because they have not realised the Brahmananda arising from Self-realisation. Whatever world it is, however rich and exhilarating the pleasures of the Gods may be, they are subject to death and birth. They have to return.",
      "What if the shackles are made of gold? They are still bonds which limit the immeasurable joy of self-realisation. That cannot be the goal. The cycle of birth and death should be stopped by knowing the truth, which al alone brings freedom to man. To be a slave here or in Heaven cannot satisfy the true aspirant. He should aim at the highest, the Atmic state, attaining which he is forever in bliss and blessedness.",
      "Therefore the wise man should strive for the Eternal state of Brahman, and not the transitory enjoyments of Heaven or any other world. The Vedas deal with sacrifices and other forms of worship which lead to enjoyment, but that is not the end of the Vedas. The end is Brahma jnana, and all people should have to come up to this goal. Sacrifices purify the mind, if they are performed without any desire for the fruit thereof. But if man performs these things with attachment he cannot derive the necessary purity to remain steadfast in the contemplation of the Self.",
      "The deluded soul thirsting for enjoyment prays to the Lord for Heavenly joys through the performance of sacrifices. How unwise it would be to stand before the Supreme Lord and pray for such meager pleasures of Heaven? Is not the Lord, the very source of all bliss and blessedness? Why not pray for union with Him? Why not pray for the bliss of liberation?",
      "If liberation is the goal of mankind, the question may arise why the Vedas have so elaborately described the Yajnas yielding various worldly and other-worldly benefits? What is its purpose? The answer is that man has to be weaned away from lower sinful pleasures by presenting before him the purer and more lasting joys of Heaven. The Vedas have done this. Man is partially rescued from the clutches of earthly things and sinful activities. Then after many many births, the same man would find out for himself that he has no rest wherever he might go, and that he has to fall back to the earth again and again. When he realises the uselessness of these enjoyments, then he would naturally seek for a joy that would not come to an end, and that joy cannot be had anywhere else except in the Self Atma.",

      "The Lord explains very clearly how the desire-prompted men do not find rest either here or in Heaven. They have to go through the painful process of birth and death. Dying here, they go to Heaven and from there, after exhausting the fruits of merit (punya) they fall back again to the earth, and take birth as mortals. Such is the fate of men yielding to desire, however rich and vast it might be. From this one understands that human life is the only opportunity for Self-realisation. All the other worlds are worlds of enjoyment good or bad. This world is the world of action and jnana. Let us hear the exhortation of Swami Vivekananda – “Man therefore according to Vedanta philosophy is the greatest being that is in the universe, and the world of work is the best place in it, because only herein is the greatest and best chance for him to become perfect. Angels or  Gods whatever you may call them, have all to become men, if they want to be perfect. This is the greatest centre, the wonderful poise, and the wonderful opportunity – this human life.”",
      "The Vedas follow a rational order with reference to human life and man’s progress and perfection. The first part is Karma Kanda, the second Upasana Kanda, and the third Janana Kanda. We see how man develops gradually and reaches perfection. The Karma Kanda deals with the desire-fulfilling actions of man. When man discovers that these desires and their fulfillment do not give him rest or peace, he discards them and rises a step higher, and finally, remains at perfection in the realisation of God. He comes to the Jnana Kanda.",
      "Karma is no doubt good in itself, but it should be free from desire and attachment. Otherwise, man has to undergo the painful process of being born again and again either here or in the other worlds. In the Samkhya-yoga and in many other places, the Lord emphasises the need for the elimination of desire as the only way to perfection. Desire implies imperfection. The perfect man cannot have any desires.",

This type of devotee is far different from others who desire enjoyments in Heaven, or in other worlds. The latter also worships the Lord, but his mind is attached to enjoyments. This is not ‘ananyabhakti‘. The devotee mentioned in this verse has no relish for anything except the Lord. All other things up to Brahmaloka are trash for him. He discards them all as loathsome stuff. Such a devotee is the Lord’s own. To have such devotion distinguishes the true Bhakta whose responsibilities are taken over by the Lord Himself.",

      "Listen to an old story. A lazy tramp sauntering along the road saw an old man sitting at the door of his house and stopped to inquire of him the whereabouts of a certain place. “How far is such and such a village?” he asked. The old man remained silent. The man repeated his query several times. Still there was no answer. Disgusted at this, the traveller turned to go away. The old man then stood up and said, “The village of__ is only a mile from here.” “What!” said the tramp, “Why did you not speak when I asked you before?” “Because then”, said the old man, “you seemed so halting and careless about proceeding, but now you are starting off in good earnest, and you have a right to an answer.” Will you remember this story, my son? (Referring to Alasinga Perumal) Go to work, the rest will come: “Whosoever not trusting in anything else but Me, rests on Me, I supply him with everything he needs.” This is no dream.[Source]",

For a moment it was all dark, but she recalled to her mind what she had heard of the eternal promise: “Those that depend on Me giving up all other thoughts, to them I Myself carry whatever is necessary.” And she was one of the souls who could believe.[Source]",
      "I am now going to be reconciled to my life here. All my life I have been taking every circumstance as coming from Him and calmly adapting myself to it. At first in America I was almost out of my water. I was afraid I would have to give up the accustomed way of being guided by the Lord and cater for myself — and what a horrid piece of mischief and ingratitude was that. I now clearly see that He who was guiding me on the snow tops of the Himalayas and the burning plains of India is here to help me and guide me. Glory unto Him in the highest. So I have calmly fallen into my old ways. Somebody or other gives me a shelter and food, somebody or other comes to ask me to speak about Him, and I know He sends them and mine is to obey. And then He is supplying my necessities, and His will be done! “He who rests [in] Me and gives up all other self-assertion and struggles I carry to him whatever he needs.”[Source]",

When I heard this from Manomohan, I said: ‘Who is this Surendra? How does he dare make a remark like that? He keeps a carpet and pillow here and gives me some money. Is that his excuse for daring to make such an impudent remark?'”ADHAR:“I understand that he gives ten rupees a month. Isn’t that so?”MASTER:“That covers two months’ expenses. The devotees stay here and he gives the money for their service. It is he who earns the merit. What is that to me? Is it for my personal gain that I love Narendra, Rakhal, and the others?”M:“Your love for them is like a mother’s for her children.”",

When God is enshrined in the heart, many people come forward to offer their services.Once a young sannyasi went to a householder to beg his food. He had lived as a monk from his very birth; he knew nothing of worldly matters. A young daughter of the householder came out to give him alms. He turned to her mother and said, Mother, has this girl abscesses on her chest?’ The mother said: ‘No, my child. God has given her breasts to nurse her child when she becomes a mother. Thereupon the sannyasi said: “Then why should I worry about myself? Why should I beg my food? He who has created me will certainly feed me.“Listen If a woman renounces everything for her paramour, she can say to him, if need be, You wretch! I shall sit on your chest and devour you.’Nangta told me of a certain king who gave a feast to the sadhus, using plates and tumblers of gold. I noticed in the monasteries at Benares with what great respect the abbots were treated. Many wealthy up-country people stood before them with folded hands, ready to obey their commands.But a true sadhu, a man who has really renounced everything, seeks neither a gold plate nor honour. God sees that he lacks nothing. God gives the devotee everything that is needed for realizing Him.(Source:Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna)",

ButGod doesn’t take entire responsibility for a devotee unless the devotee is completely intoxicated with ecstatic love for Him. At a feast it is only a child whom one takes by the hand and seats at his place. Who does that with older people? Not until a man thinks so much of God that he cannot look after himself does God take on his responsibilities.Hazra doesn’t inquire about his family. His son said to Ramlal: ‘Please ask father to come home. We shall not ask anything of him.’ These words almost brought tears to my eyes. Hazra’s mother said to Ramlal: ‘Please ask Pratap (Hazra.) to come home just once. Also ask your uncle (The Master.) to request him to come home.’ I told him about it, but he didn’t listen to me.“Is a mother to be trifled with? Before becoming a sannyasi Chaitanyadeva worked hard to persuade his mother to let him renounce home. Mother Sachi said that she would kill Keshab Bharati.16Chaitanyadeva did his utmost to persuade her. He said: ‘Mother, I shall not renounce home if you won’t let me. But if you compel me to lead a householder’s life, I shall die. And, mother, even if I go away as a sannyasi, you will be able to see me whenever you desire. I shall stay near you. I shall see you every now and then.’ Only when Chaitanya explained it to her thus did she give her permission. Narada could not go to the forest to practise austerity as long as his mother was alive. He had to take care of her. After her death he went away to realise God.“When I went to Vrindavan I felt no desire to return to Calcutta. It was arranged that I should live with Gangama. (A great woman saint of vrindavan..) Everything was settled. My bed was to be on one side and Gangama’s on the other. I resolved not to go back to Calcutta. I said to myself, ‘How long must I eat a kaivarta’s17food?’ ‘No,’ said Hriday to me, ‘let us go to Calcutta.’ He pulled me by one hand and Gangama pulled me by the other. I felt an intense desire to live at Vrindavan. But just then I remembered my mother. That completely changed everything. She was old. I said to myself: ‘My devotion to God will take to its wings if I have to worry about my mother. I would rather live with her. Then I shall have peace of mind and be able to meditate on God.’(To Narendra) “Why don’t you say a few Words to Hazra about going home?

      "All these three verses (12.6–8) put together form the commentary for the verse ananyāścintayanto mām… (BG9.22). In verse 6, Bhagavan says, “ananyenaiva yogena māṃ dhyāyanta upāsate—they ever meditate on Me and abide in samādhi, and their ego-‘I’ has completely merged with the Infinite.” In verse 7, Bhagavan explains what is meant by yogakshemam vahāmyaham. “teṣāṃ aham mṛtyu-saṃsāra-sāgarāt samuddhartā bhavāmi—I will redeem them from the suffering that comes due to involvement with the world.” In verse 8, Bhagavan explains paryupāsanā. It is “mayyeva mana ādhatsva mayi buddhiṃ niveśaya—fixing your mind and intellect on Me, the Self.” These three verses reveal how one should meditate on the Lord with steadfast devotion, without any distraction. The well-being of one who renounces all other support and meditates on Bhagavan is taken care of by that Supreme Power of Divine Love. (Source: Srimad Bhagavad Gita – Elixir of Eternal Wisdom)",

The various Devas may confer different rewards of health and wealth, children and prosperity in worldly life, but the worship of the Supreme confers the highest reward of Moksha (liberation). Whatever may be the object of worship, faith is essential. With such faith, if the Lord is worshipped the devotee obtains liberation.",

      "This verse is very important for all aspirants. In the previousverse, it was stated that the worshipper invariably goes to the object of his worship. If the Lord is the objective, the worshipper reaches Him. The same discipline and devotion needed for the worship of other Devas is enough to please the Lord. This being so, why should he have a lesser and lower objective than the Lord Himself? The Lord explains the very easy nature of His worship. No elaborate sacrifices are needed, no large charities are needed, no great offerings are needed. A leaf, a flower or a fruit or even water, is enough to please the Lord, and when the Lord is pleased, all the Devas, Pitris and Bhutas are pleased. All the rewards which the worshippers hope to derive from the worship of the Devas are derived by the worship of Paramatma and His worship is absolutely within the reach of every human being. Two conditions are stated here:",
      "Kingdom, treasures and empires do not satisfy the Lord when there is no purity and devotion; where these are, even a leaf or a fruit is enough to draw the grace of God.

She thought of the Lord and he came and tasted the few bits of cooked food, and lo, the miracle! and his disciples felt surfeited and could take no more food, even when they were requested by Pandavas to accept their hospitality. Please the Lord, and all other beings shall be pleased.",

Thou who feedest the universe, accept my poor offerings of fruits. I am weak, I am ignorant. I do not know how to approach Thee, how to worship Thee, my God, my Cowherd, my child; let my worship be pure, my love for Thee selfless; and if there is any virtue in worship, let it be Thine, grant me only love, love that never asks for anything — ‘never seeks for anything but love’.”[Source]",
      "… Continue your sadhana [spiritual practices]. It will surely bear results. The saint Tulasidas said, “Whatever way you sow the seed in the soil, pointing either up or down, its sprout will rise upward.” Similarly, if you practise your sadhana wholeheartedly, it will produce good results, even though your means may not be perfect. If you have real devotion in your heart, the Lord will see it; he does not count human imperfections. The Lord knows our inmost thoughts. There is a saying: “The prayer of an unlettered person may be grammatically wrong and the prayer of a learned man may be correct, but both prayers will render the same virtue; because God accepts only the inmost feelings.” …",

Everything should be offered to the Lord, the food eaten, the sacrifice made, and the austerity performed.

To the house-holders particularly this method is of great help in their spiritual advancement.",

      "Here are the two ways of giving up all attachment. The one is for those who do not believe in God, or in any outside help. They are left to their own devices; they have simply to work with their own will, with the powers of their mind and discrimination, saying, “I must be non-attached”. For those who believe in God there is another way, which is much less difficult. They give up the fruits of work unto the Lord; they work and are never attached to the results. Whatever they see, feel, hear, or do, is for Him. For whatever good work we may do, let us not claim any praise or benefit. It is the Lord’s; give up the fruits unto Him. Let us stand aside and think that we are only servants obeying the Lord, our Master, and that every impulse for action comes from Him every moment. Whatever thou worshippest, whatever thou perceivest, whatever thou doest, give up all unto Him and be at rest. Let us be at peace, perfect peace, with ourselves, and give up our whole body and mind and everything as an eternal sacrifice unto the Lord. Instead of the sacrifice of pouring oblations into the fire, perform this one great sacrifice day and night — the sacrifice of your little self.[Source]",

      "Two monks had arrived at the temple garden in the morning. They were devoted to the study of the Bhagavad Gita, the Vedanta, and other scriptures. They entered the Master’s room, saluted him, and sat on the mat on the floor. Sri Ramakrishna was seated on the small couch. The Master spoke to the sadhus in Hindusthani.MASTER:“Have you had your meal?”SADHU:“Yes, sir.”MASTER:“What did you eat?”SADHU:“Dal and bread. Will you take some?”MASTER:“No, I take only a few morsels of rice. Well, your japa and meditation must be without any desire for results. Isn’t that so?”SADHU:“Yes, sir.”MASTER:“That is good. One must surrender the result to God. What do you say? That is the view of theGita.”One sadhu said to the other, quoting from theGita:‘O Arjuna, whatever action you perform, whatever you eat, whatever you offer in sacrifice, whatever you give in charity, and whatever austerities you practise, offer everything to Me.”MASTER:“If you give God something, you receive it back a thousand times over. That is why after doing meritorious deeds one offers a handful of water to God. It is the symbol of offering the fruit to God. When Yudhisthira was about to offer all his sins to Krishna, Bhima warned him: ‘Never do such a thing. Whatever you offer to Krishna you will receive back a thousandfold.’(To one of the sadhus) “Well, sir, one should be desireless; one should renounce all desires. Isn’t that so?”SADHU:“Yes, sir.”MASTER:“But I have the desire for bhakti. That is not bad. Rather, it is good. Sweets are bad, for they produce acidity. But sugar candy is an exception. Isn’t that so?”SADHU:“Yes, sir.”MASTER:“Well, sir, what do you think of the Vedanta?”SADHU:“It includes all the six systems of philosophy.”MASTER:“But the essence of Vedanta is: ‘Brahman alone is real, and the world illusory; I have no separate existence; I am that Brahman alone.’ Isn’t that so?”SADHU:“That is true, sir.”MASTER:“But for those who lead a householder’s life, and those who identify themselves with the body, this attitude of ‘I am He’ is not good. It is not good for householders to read Vedanta or theYogavasishtha. It is very harmful for them to read these books. Householders should look on God as their Master and on themselves as His servants. They should think, ‘O God, You are the Master and the Lord, and I am Your servant.’ People who identify themselves with the body should not have the attitude of ‘I am He.”The devotees in the room remained silent. Sri Ramakrishna was smiling a little, a picture of self-contentment. He appeared happy in his own Self.One of the sadhus whispered in the other’s ear: “Look! This is the state of the paramahamsa.”MASTER (to M.):“I feel like laughing.”Sri Ramakrishna smiled like a child. (Source:Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna)",

Both are necessary.”",
      "BRAHMO:“Sir, is it good to worship God with form, an image of the Deity made of clay?”",
      "MASTER:“You do not accept God with form. That is all right. The image is not meant for you. For you it is good to deepen your feeling toward your own Ideal. From the worshippers of the Personal God you should learn their yearning — for instance, Sri Krishna’s attraction for Radha. You should learn from the worshippers of the Personal God their love for their Chosen Ideal.

The Lord has nothing to do with the ups and downs, losses and gains, pleasures and pains of all beings. Each one reaps the fruits of his own thoughts and actions. One reaps what he sows. The law is universal and eternal. Let the seeker realise the full responsibility for the good and bad that comes to him. Let him never shift the blame to anyone else.",

      "How much more, then, if they be holy brāhmins or royal seers devoted to God! Having come into this transitory, joyless world, worship Me."
    ],
    "commentary": [
      "If people of sinful birth, as well as women and sudras are competent to attain Brahmajnana, how much easier it should be for the holy Brahmins and royal saints? The attributes ‘punyah’ and ‘bhaktah’ are used to emphasise the need for the possession of these qualities which alone entitle a man to reach the highest state. Mere birth cannot take any man anywhere. It is not a passport to God-realisation. Purity and devotion are absolutely essential.",
      "Rajarshayah:Self-control is the attribute of a saint (Rishi). Kings who attained self-mastery are Rajarshis. Entangled in the day-to-day complications of earthly rule, if the Kings could acquire purity and perfection, will it not be possible for humble house-holders who have lesser burdens and greater freedom to attain the supreme goal?",
      "Anityam asukham lokam:This world or this birth or the body is impermanent and unhappy. Unless a man is blind or demented, he would naturally realise by observation and experience that the Lord’s description of the world is perfectly true. The impermanent nature of the world is an everyday fact, and all that is matter shall disintegrate sooner or later. The earthen pot shall go back to the earth. The bodies made up of the five elements shall go back to the elements. Nothing can stop it. What then? The wise man should hold on to the Lord. “Worship Me” is the Lord’s command. Since death is stalking the world the immediate need for the worship of the Lord is explained. Before the body falls, the Lord should be realised. This is the most urgent aim. All other things come and go according to one’s karma (Prarabdha). Worship of the Lord is the very essence of life.",
      "The world is not only momentary but it is full of misery, devoid of happiness (asukham).",
      "There is no real joy in little earthly things, Joy is only in the infinite Atma. Man discovers this truth after a long experience. The pain that poisons all earthly enjoyments is slowly and gradually understood by discrimination, observation, and experience.  Then the man turns away from the world and takes refuge in the Lord,",
      "‘Worship Me’ is the Lord’s command. The world is impermanent and painful. Worship of the Lord who is real and who is the very ocean of bliss is the only way to rise above the painful dream of the world.   The unreal is rejected by taking refuge in the Real, and the unhappy should be given up by discovering that which is truly the embodiment of joy (i.e) the Lord. Therefore let no man be tempted by the superficial attractions of the shadowy world, but let him seek the source of all that is Truth, Beauty, and Peace (Satyam, Sivam, Sundaram).",
      "“It is said that there are four classes of human beings: the bound, those aspiring after liberation, the liberated, and the ever-perfect.",
      "“This world is like a fishing net. Men are the fish, and God, whose maya has created this world, is the fisherman. When the fish are entangled in the net, some of them try to tear through its meshes in order to get their liberation. They are like the men striving after liberation. But by no means all of them escape. Only a few jump out of the net with a loud splash, and then people say, ‘Ah! There goes a big one!’ In like manner, three or four men attain liberation. Again, some fish are so careful by nature that they are never caught in the net; some beings of the ever-perfect class, like Narada, are never entangled in the meshes of worldliness. Most of the fish are trapped; but they are not conscious of the net and of their imminent death. No sooner are they entangled than they run headlong, net and all, trying to hide themselves in the mud. They don’t make the least effort to get free. On the contrary, they go deeper and deeper into the mud. These fish are like the bound men. They are still inside the net, but they think they are quite safe there. A bound creature is immersed in worldliness, in ‘woman and gold’, having gone deep into the mire of degradation. But still he believes he is quite happy and secure. The liberated, and the seekers after liberation, look on the world as a deep well. They do not enjoy it. Therefore, after the attainment of Knowledge, the realisation of God, some give up their bodies. But such a thing is rare indeed.",
      "“The bound creatures, entangled in worldliness, will not come to their senses at all. They suffer so much misery and agony, they face so many dangers, and yet they will not wake up.“The camel loves to eat thorny bushes. The more it eats the thorns, the more the blood gushes from its mouth. Still it must eat thorny plants and will never give them up. The man of worldly nature suffers so much sorrow and affliction, but he forgets it all in a few days and begins his old life over again. Suppose a man has lost his wife or she has turned unfaithful. Lo! He marries again.“Or take the instance of a mother: her son dies and she suffers bitter grief; but after a few days she forgets all about it. The mother, so overwhelmed with sorrow a few days before, now attends to her toilet and puts on her jewelry. A father becomes bankrupt through the marriage of his daughters, yet he goes on having children year after year. People are ruined by litigation, yet they go to court all the same. There are men who cannot feed the children they have, who cannot clothe them or provide decent shelter for them; yet they have more children every year.“Again, the worldly man is like a snake trying to swallow a mole. The snake can neither swallow the mole nor give it up. The bound soul may have realised that there is no substance to the world — that the world is like a hog plum, only stone and skin — but still he cannot give it up and turn his mind to God.“I once met a relative of Keshab Sen, fifty years old. He was playing cards. As if the time had not yet come for him to think of God!“There is another characteristic of the bound soul. If you remove him from his worldly surroundings to a spiritual environment, he will pine away. The worm that grows in filth feels very happy there. It thrives in filth. It will die if you put it in a pot of rice.”All remained silent.",

    ],
    "commentary": [
      "The way to reach Paramatma is clearly stated here. The seeker should converge all his activities towards that one Supreme Goal. He should think of the Lord, be devoted to Him, offer sacrifice to Him, and worship Him with all faith and humility. In word, thought and deed, he should worship the Lord. Generally, the mind wanders in the realm of the sensuous. It should be withdrawn from the world and centred in Atma. This is possible by contemplating the glorious attributes of the Self. Such contemplation develops love and adoration for the Lord. Thus thinking constantly of the blissful and ever-glorious Self, man unites himself with the Supreme. He worships Him with all devotion and humility.",
      "The mind becomes that which it constantly contemplates. This is the law. Having for long contemplated worldly objects, the mind has become the world; if the mind is trained to contemplate Paramatma, it becomes that according to the same law; that is, the union of the individual self with the universal Self. This state is realised by constant contemplation and meditation on the Self, the Lord.",
      "Let the seekers put themselves these questions – On what is their mind resting? Is it on the world or on Paramatma? To what are they devoted? It is to the world or to the Lord? What do they worship? Is it the world of name and form or Paramatma? Where do they live and have their being? It is in the world of the senses or the seat of Atma? The Lord points the way, the only way to peace and bliss.",
      "Question:What is the way to reach the Lord?",
      "Answer:Fill the mind with Him, be devoted to Him, sacrifice unto Him, prostrate before Him. In this way, continuously live and have your being in the Lord."
