    "sanskrit": "श्रीभगवानुवाच |इदं तु ते गुह्यतमं प्रवक्ष्याम्यनसूयवे |ज्ञानं विज्ञानसहितं यज्ज्ञात्वा मोक्ष्यसेऽशुभात् || 1||",
    "transliteration": "śhrī bhagavān uvāchaidaṁ tu te guhyatamaṁ pravakṣhyāmyanasūyavejñānaṁ vijñāna-sahitaṁ yaj jñātvā mokṣhyase ’śhubhāt",
    "word_by_word_meaning": "śhrī-bhagavān uvācha—the Supreme Lord said; idam—this; tu—but; te—to you; guhya-tamam—the most confidential; pravakṣhyāmi—I shall impart; anasūyave—nonenvious; jñānam—knowledge; vijñāna—realized knowledge; sahitam—with; yat—which; jñātvā—knowing; mokṣhyase—you will be released; aśhubhāt—miseries of material existence",
    "translation": "The Lord said: To you, free from malice and cavil, I shall declare this profoundest secret, knowledge with experience combined, which having known, you shall be freed from all evil.",
    "commentary": "The Lord now teaches the highest knowledge (Atmajnana) and the profoundest secret (rajaguhyam) combined with direct practical experience. The word ‘guhyatamam’ indicates that the knowledge is the highest secret, beyond which there is nothing else to be known. The teaching of Brahmajnana is usually done to those who are qualified to receive it, or even to hear of it. What is that quality which entitles a person to hear and understand Brahmatatvam? The Lord answers it here by stating that Arjuna is free from malice (asuya). He is pure in heart and has the four qualities mentioned in the Sastras (sadhana chatushtaya). So the Lord reveals the supreme knowledge. Those who are eager to receive the knowledge from a Guru should first of all examine themselves and know fully well whether they are established in virtue and self-control. Brahmajnana will never reveal itself in the impure heart, whatever other things one may possess, power or position. These things do not qualify anyone to understand the Truth. The pure soul knows the secret and attains Brahman.",

    "word_by_word_meaning": "rāja-vidyā—the king of sciences; rāja-guhyam—the most profound secret; pavitram—pure; idam—this; uttamam—highest; pratyakṣha—directly perceptible; avagamam—directly realizable; dharmyam—virtuous; su-sukham—easy; kartum—to practice; avyayam—everlasting",
    "translation": "It is the sovereign science, the sovereign mystery, and the supreme purifier. It is perceived by direct experience, it accords with dharma, it is easy to practise, and it is imperishable.",
    "commentary": "All other sciences cannot bestow peace and bliss on mankind. Worldly knowledge can only deal with material things which are perishable. The profound mystery of life and death and immortality can be understood only when Brahman is realised. All other things are ‘anatma’, ‘jada’, insentient. They are impure. Atma the self, Brahman alone is pure and perfect. So this knowledge which reveals the ultimate Truth is declared to be royal knowledge and royal secret.",

    "translation": "People who have no faith in this dharma are unable to attain Me, O conqueror of enemies. They repeatedly come back to this world in the cycle of birth and death.",
    "commentary": "Whether in worldly or spiritual life, faith and devotion to an ideal is the key to success. The degree of success depends on the intensity of one’s faith. Man becomes that which he aims at, the time taken depending on the intensity of the effort, and the strength of the obstructing forces. Sooner or later, it is certain that man achieves what he yearns for with single-minded devotion.",

    "translation": "And yet, the living beings do not abide in Me. Behold the mystery of My divine energy! Although I am the Creator and Sustainer of all living beings, I am not influenced by them or by material nature.",
    "commentary": "There appears to be an apparent contradiction. In the previousverse, it was declared that all beings are in the Lord. Here it is stated that the beings also are not in Him. The contradiction is only apparent and not real. From the point of view of the ignorant, the world has an existence, as it is touched and confirmed by the senses. So it is said to exist in, and sustained by Paramatma. From the Advaitic plane, the world does not exist at all, in the same manner as water does not exist in the mirage. So it is said here that the beings also do not exist in Him. This is from the pure Advaitic point of view, where there is only one undifferentiated eternal Brahman, and nothing else. The Lord’s declaration means that Drisya the seen world does not exist in Him, or He in Drisya. The man who has awakended from the dream comes to know that he never existed in the dream nor the dream in him. It is nothing. The man who saw the snake in the rope, when he comes to know the form of the rope, knows that snake did not and does not exist. Thus, there are no beings in the Lord, nor He in them. What existed, exists, and shall exist is Paramatma alone. This is the sovereign yoga of the Lord. The cosmic illusion appears to exist but really does not exist. So the world while appearing to exist, does not exist. All this is Brahman and nothing else. This is the royal secret.",

    "word_by_word_meaning": "yathā—as; ākāśha-sthitaḥ—rests in the sky; nityam—always; vāyuḥ—the wind; sarvatra-gaḥ—blowing everywhere; mahān—mighty; tathā—likewise; sarvāṇi bhūtāni—all living beings; mat-sthāni—rest in Me; iti—thus; upadhāraya—know",
    "translation": "Know that as the mighty wind blowing everywhere rests always in the sky(ether), likewise, all living beings always rest in Me.",
    "commentary": "The Lord gives a beautiful simile to explain what He has said in the previous two verses. Just as the mighty wind rests in the ether which has no contact with the wind, so also all beings rest in Brahman, who is not contaminated by them at all. The objects cannot produce any effect on Him. The mighty wind rests in some part of the elemental ether. So also, the whole universe is in some spot in the supreme Brahman. The wind may carry good or foul smell, may be gentle or strong, but ether is not affected by it. So also, the good and bad in man or the actions taking place in the world do not effect Brahman. Ether cannot be seen, so also Paramatma; ether is subtle, Paramatma is more subtle; ether pervades all, so also, Paramatma pervades all beings. This illustration of ether and the wind resting in it is intended for the understanding of the common people only. In fact, ether cannot be compared to Paramatma, because ether is insentient and Paramatma on the other hand is supreme consciousness.",

The Jiva is bound by the actions which he does by the force of Nature. All beings come under the power of nature, except those who have gone beyond Nature and reached the ultimate Paramatma. The Jivanmuktas have gone beyond Maya. Nature has no power over them. All other beings come out and go back into Nature endlessly and suffer all the ills and troubles of life and death.",

One may read or work, another may commit murder and so on. But these actions do not affect the Sun at all. He is just the witness, that is all, and no more. So also, the Lord is not concerned with the tremendous activity of Prakriti. He is unattached, perfectly indifferent to all that is done or not done. Such freedom comes to those who have Self – realisation. Is not that freedom worth having? Why should man be a slave? Let one approach the Lord and pray to Him to free him from the shackles which he has forged for himself in a state of ignorance.",

In the vicinity of a magnet, the iron needle moves. The magnet has no particular agency in this. It is just where it is. This Paramatma is in the universe like an unconcerned entity Udasina. But His immediate proximity enables Prakriti to create things. The word adhyakshena is used here to indicate the non-attachment and the consciousness – Principle of the Lord. An assembly, so to say, has no life till the president takes the chair. A Court, so to say, has no life till the judge takes his seat. When he takes the seat, the whole assembly is animated with life and goes into action. So also, Prakriti remains inert till it is animated by the presence of the Lord and brings forth the whole universe. Without Him, the universe would simply be inert matter and nothing more.",

He has already declared that, though he has no birth, he appears to be born in the world for the purpose of establishing Dharma and protecting the righteous. When he assumes the human form, the deluded disregard Him as no more than other mortals. There are some people proud of their position and wealth, ill-treating and abusing saints and sadhus. As the saints and sadhus are devoid of worldly goods like wealth and position, some people show no respect for them. The Bhakta and Bhagavan are one. The Lord is present in His devotees and they have to be honoured as such. Sisupala and Duryodhana never understood the Divine nature of Lord Krishna.

Their hopes are vain, empty, their actions are vain, producing nothing good or permanent. Their knowledge is also vain, because it is confined to the senses and the perishable world. Such knowledge viewed from the spiritual plane is empty, vain and useless. They are devoid of understanding and so they have no thought of anything beyond the body. Such men are possessed of the devilish and undivine nature. The Tamasic Guna or the dark quality of Prakriti characterises the beings here spoken of as rakshasic and asuric. Rakshasas are semi-human beings, brutal and blood-thristry. The asuras are the opponents of the Devas. The Devas have sattvaguna. The asuras possess rajoguna. They have evil desires and use their powers in evil ways. Their life is useless. That is why the world useless (mogha) is repeated three times in this verse. The point is that all those people live in the empty world of Maya. So whatever they do or think or hope is empty nothing, signifying nothing.",

Their prayer is for heavenly joys. And they get them by the merit of their Yajnas.

    "commentary": "The Lord explains very clearly how the desire-prompted men do not find rest either here or in Heaven. They have to go through the painful process of birth and death. Dying here, they go to Heaven and from there, after exhausting the fruits of merit (punya) they fall back again to the earth, and take birth as mortals. Such is the fate of men yielding to desire, however rich and vast it might be. From this one understands that human life is the only opportunity for Self-realisation. All the other worlds are worlds of enjoyment good or bad. This world is the world of action and jnana. Let us hear the exhortation of Swami Vivekananda – “Man therefore according to Vedanta philosophy is the greatest being that is in the universe, and the world of work is the best place in it, because only herein is the greatest and best chance for him to become perfect. Angels or  Gods whatever you may call them, have all to become men, if they want to be perfect. This is the greatest centre, the wonderful poise, and the wonderful opportunity – this human life.”",

He takes upon Himself the responsibility of the devotee, who is ever united with Him.Yogameans securing things which are not already possessed by the devotee.Kshemameans preservation of things already possessed.Nothing can cause fear to the true devotee about his welfare, as the Lord Himself has taken over the entire responsibility. Let him be true to Him, and the never-failing hand of God is always there to protect him. The Lord knows full well that His devotees have given their all to Him, and have nothing of their own.

If their devotion is sincere, they in a sense, worship the supreme who is the foundation for all Devas. This form of worship is the wrong method. They are not worshipping the Supreme directly. So there is a difference in the fruits of merit. The various Devas may confer different rewards of health and wealth, children and prosperity in worldly life, but the worship of the Supreme confers the highest reward of Moksha (liberation). Whatever may be the object of worship, faith is essential. With such faith, if the Lord is worshipped the devotee obtains liberation.",

Let the aspirant think clearly of the goal he has to reach. Let him not be content with lesser things which have brought misery and death endlessly.

If the Lord is the objective, the worshipper reaches Him. The same discipline and devotion needed for the worship of other Devas is enough to please the Lord. This being so, why should he have a lesser and lower objective than the Lord Himself? The Lord explains the very easy nature of His worship. No elaborate sacrifices are needed, no large charities are needed, no great offerings are needed. A leaf, a flower or a fruit or even water, is enough to please the Lord, and when the Lord is pleased, all the Devas, Pitris and Bhutas are pleased. All the rewards which the worshippers hope to derive from the worship of the Devas are derived by the worship of Paramatma and His worship is absolutely within the reach of every human being.

    "commentary": "Though the most wicked of men, if he takes refuge in the Lord with faith and devotion, striving to give up his wickedness, he should be regarded as a righteous and holy person. The Lord uses the superlative term (sudurucharah) to indicate the worst forms of sin and evil. Even such a person should be known as holy by virtue of his absolute self-surrender to the Lord. The reason is that he has come to the right decision thatParamatmais the only Reality and he has obtained a glimpse of this ultimate truth. He has realised the illusory nature of the world, and so he has taken final refuge in the only Reality-Paramatma. His decision is right and his salvation is then assured by the Lord.",

    "commentary": "If people of sinful birth, as well as women and sudras are competent to attain Brahmajnana, how much easier it should be for the holy Brahmins and royal saints? The attributes ‘punyah’ and ‘bhaktah’ are used to emphasise the need for the possession of these qualities which alone entitle a man to reach the highest state. Mere birth cannot take any man anywhere. It is not a passport to God-realisation. Purity and devotion are absolutely essential.",

    "commentary": "The way to reach Paramatma is clearly stated here. The seeker should converge all his activities towards that one Supreme Goal. He should think of the Lord, be devoted to Him, offer sacrifice to Him, and worship Him with all faith and humility. In word, thought and deed, he should worship the Lord. Generally, the mind wanders in the realm of the sensuous. It should be withdrawn from the world and centred in Atma. This is possible by contemplating the glorious attributes of the Self. Such contemplation develops love and adoration for the Lord. Thus thinking constantly of the blissful and ever-glorious Self, man unites himself with the Supreme. He worships Him with all devotion and humility.",
