    "transliteration": "arjuna uvāchajyāyasī chet karmaṇas te matā buddhir janārdanatat kiṁ karmaṇi ghore māṁ niyojayasi keśhava",
    "word_by_word_meaning": "arjunaḥ uvācha—Arjun said; jyāyasī—superior; chet—if; karmaṇaḥ—than fruitive action; te—by you; matā—is considered; buddhiḥ—intellect; janārdana—he who looks after the public, Krishna; tat—then; kim—why; karmaṇi—action; ghore—terrible; mām—me; niyojayasi—do you engage; keśhava—Krishna, the killer of the demon named Keshi;",
    "translation": "Arjuna said: O Krishna! If your belief is that knowledge is superior to action, then why do you engage me in this dreadful act of battle?",
    "commentary": "In verses49,50,51of Samkhya Yoga, the Lord declared the superiority of knowledge to action. The doubt might have crept into Arjuna’s mind even then. But the Lord proceeded to speak of samadhi, and the ultimate union of the individual with Paramatma, and hence Arjuna simply put the question about the characteristics of the sthitaprajana. The Lord answered the question and explained the highest Brahmi Sthiti and the Samkhya Yoga comes to an end with it. Now Arjuna wanted to have the doubt cleared by the Lord, how he should reconcile the two paths of knowledge (Juana) and work (Karma). So he presents his doubt in the first two verses.",

    "translation": "With these apparently contradictory words, You seem to confuse my understanding. Therefore tell me definitely that one thing by which I shall reach the Highest Goal.",
    "commentary": "The word iva (as it were) is used twice in this verse. It means that Arjuna has full faith in the Lord, that he is not actually puzzling the intellect, but that, out of his own ignorance, it appears to him that the two doctrines of Jnana and Karma are contradictory to each other. Hence with child-like innocence, Arjuna wants to know for certain what course would be best for him to attain the highest.",

    "word_by_word_meaning": "śhrī-bhagavān uvācha—the Blessed Lord said; loke—in the world; asmin—this; dvi-vidhā—two kinds of; niṣhṭhā—faith; purā—previously; proktā—explained; mayā—by me (Shree Krishna); anagha—sinless; jñāna-yogena—through the path of knowledge; sānkhyānām—for those inclined toward contemplation; karma-yogena—through the path of action; yoginām—of the yogis",
    "translation": "The Blessed Lord said: O sinless Arjuna! In ancient times two paths of spiritual description were spoken by me – the Jnana yoga for the followers of the path of knowledge, and Karma yoga for the followers of the path of action.",
    "commentary": "O Sinless:Arjuna is free from sin. So he is fully qualified to receive the highest wisdom. When the cloth is clean, it can be dyed in any colour. The Lord knew the purity of Arjuna’s mind, and therefore he chose to teach him Brahma Vidya. Each individual, according to his ingrained disposition, seeks the path which is congenial to his nature. Some are born with an intellectual frame of mind and the path for them is that of enquiring into the Self (Jnana yoga). For these, the Lord taught the path of knowledge. Others are born with a practical temperament, and they love action. For them, the Lord pointed out another path – karma yoga. Each man is perfectly free to choose his own path. There is no compulsion. Any course of imposed discipline will go against nature, and will not yield the desired result. There may be many roads leading to the same destination. There may be different routes to climb up a peak. Any route will ultimately take the people to the top of the mountain. So the Lord here declares that man may follow any path which is agreeable to his character and reach the goal. Though in the Gita several yogas are stated, all of them can be brought under these two main divisions – Jnana Yoga and Karma Yoga.",

It is the mind that moves the bodily organs of action and the sense-organs of perception. So the mind should be kept detached from desire and longing for material pleasures.

    "translation": "O Arjuna! Works other than those performed for the sake of sacrifice (Yajna) binds this world. So perform work for sacrifice without attachment.",
    "commentary": "The teacher of the Gita dives new interpretations to familiarise with terms like yajna, sannyasa, tyaga etc. Ordinarily, yajna means a certain form of ritual, accompanied with the sacred fire, oblations, mantras and tantras, and other rites. The Lord defines the word as an act performed with no selfish motive for the service or humanity. Whatever may be the scope of work, great or small, if it is done as an act of dedication to God and service to beings, it becomes a yajna. This is within the capability of all men to perform and acquire merit. Generally, it is a mistaken view to think that karma binds men to Samsara. And even if it is good work, man has to be born again and again to enjoy the fruits of suchkarma. They argue that karma should be given up. But the Lord clears this misconception. When karma is done with the desire of enjoying its fruits, it binds man to the wheel of birth and death. What is done without desire and attachment cannot bind man. On the other hand, it purifies the mind and heart and leads to ultimate freedom.",

He who enjoys these material things without offering them to the Gods or to fellow – beings in the form of God, is indeed a thief because he enjoys objects without paying the price for them. Food, water, air, and other things which we use belong to God. They are not manufactured by us. What we call the discoveries and inventions of modern science are combinations and modifications of things already created, and the utilisation of powers already present in nature. In fact, even the intelligence of man is itself the gift of God. So from first to last, in every way, and for every thing, man is indebted to God. Anyone who forgets to offer Him what belongs to him only should be regarded as a thief. Gratitude and devotion are the proper price that one should pay to enjoy the fruits of life. Offering them to God or to fellow beings is the first duty for all mankind. Otherwise, people will lay themselves open to the charge of being robbers and dacoits who misappropriate what does not belong to them.",

They were all emperors who followed the doctrine of Nishkama karma and attained the highest spiritual goal. It is an ancient way of life, and men of the greatest responsibilities in the world understood the secret of the work and practised it in their daily life. Arjuna, a prince of the Royal family of Bharata, could do it. It is an answer to the doubt whether man could attain Moksha while engaged in the practical duties of the world, and whether work could lead to liberation. Nishkama karma purifies the mind and knowledge dawns at once. It is said in the Yoga Vasista that Janaka performed many acts of righteousness without attachment, purified his mind thereby, and by enquiry into the Self, realised the Supreme Being.",

He is everything, and yet out of compassion for humanity, He incarnates Himself, again and again, to maintain Dharma for the well-being and progress of the world. He is ceaselessly working everywhere for establishing Dharma. He, the infinite formless Brahman, takes birth, comes into the world, mingles with men, teaches them, elevates them, and leads them on to freedom and bliss. If the Lord Himself is thus engaged in work, should not the common man work for his own good? The great Jivanmuktas like Buddha, Shankara, and a long line of sages and prophets have all done tremendous work in the World. Why? Not for their own gain, because they have nothing to gain, but for the sake of humanity. So the seekers and aspirants should do honest and sincere work to purify themselves and attain the spiritual aim. They should not be inactive, because inaction is tamas. Work, work, is the Lord’s command. Work without attachment, performing one’s duty unmindful of the results, is the law of karma yoga.",

Thus the human organism and the universe around are the product of Nature. All actions wherever and in whatever manner they take place are actually done by the power of the three gunas. Atma remains as the eternal uncontaminated witness. The real man is Atma. It is the witness of the body, the internal and external organs, and the modifications of the mind. In truth, the real man is not the doer. All the actions that man apparently performs with his physical and subtle organs is the work of Nature, and not of the man himself in his real Being.

    "translation": "Even a wise man acts according to his own nature. Beings follow nature; what can restraint do?",
    "commentary": "The term-a wise man (Jnanavan) refers only to a learned man who intellectually understands the principles of religion and philosophy. He has yet to realise the Truth. Mere intellectual culture and understanding of the Sastras are powerless to control the tremendous power of natural instincts and tendencies with which a man is born in this world. Though he knows much of spiritual lore, he acts in conformity with his own nature, the impulses and thought patterns formed through a series of births. If such is the case with a learned man, what to speak of the ignorant!",

It would be wrong to interpret from the previous verse that the Lord was stating the impossibility of overcoming Nature. Man should not come under the sway of the material forces operating in the human personality. That is the Lord’s injunction.So the whole progress of spiritual life is one continuous and systematic attempt to counteract the natural forces till they are completely subdued.All the different paths, methods, practices and disciplines have only one end in view, and that is theconquest of Nature in all its subtle forms and manifestations.",

To neglect his duty and adopt the duty of another is dangerous because it would upset the order of the world, and create confusion and chaos in society. In the First Discourse, Arjuna spoke in a mood of despondency that he would prefer to live on alms like a mendicant than kill his relations and friends in battle. The Lord here states the law for a Kshatriya and the danger of neglecting it and adopting the life of another.",

    "commentary": "In the heart of every being, the light of Atma is always shining. But it is not seen because it is covered up by kama and krodha. To explain this, the Lord uses three illustrations – (1) as fire being covered by smoke, (2) a mirror being covered by dust, and (3) the embryo being enveloped by the amnion. When smoke is cleared away by fanning, the fire underneath shines bright. When the dust is rubbed off, the mirror shines in all its purity. Also when the amnion is removed the newborn comes out free from the womb. In the same way, when the enveloping force of kama is dispelled by the practice of devotion, dispassion, selfless action, and knowledge, the light of Atma shines forth in all its effulgence. When Atma manifests, man attains liberation and gets freedom from all-enveloping forces.",

External enemies are not so persistent. Sometimes a former enemy may become a present friend. So they are not perpetual enemies. But Kama is a constant foe, ever-scheming and plotting how to fringe and bring down the spiritual aspirant. Highly learned scholars, kings and heroes, the Gods of the different worlds, are struck down by kama at one time or other. Even highly advanced spiritual seekers, if they are not careful for a minute, are trapped by kama and lose their freedom. Though its external manifestations are checked by conscious efforts, yet it remains in a seed-form in the heart, and comes out when there is a suitable opportunity. So the seeker should be vigilant and with firm determination should strike down the enemy whenever he lifts his head in any form whatsoever.",

The stronghold of kama is the senses, the mind, and the intellect. With these under its power, kama veils the knowledge of Self and deludes mankind by attachment to the body and the material world. So the first step for the seeker is to bring the senses under his own control, by driving out kama from its stronghold. Then the mind becomes pure, and the discriminative intellect clear. When kama is thus driven out of its hiding place and feeding ground, it becomes weak and gradually dies for want of sustenance.",

    "commentary": "Kama (lust) functions by first enslaving the senses, then deluding the mind, and then confusing the intellect. In the actual act of enjoyment, no one can make the division. But sadhana consists in analysing the mechanism of the body and mind. The Lord insists on sense-control as the first step to get rid of kama. The senses are like the main gateway of a fort. If the enemy is attacked and repelled at the gate, he cannot enter the fort. The senses should not be allowed to possess the mind by filling it with sense objects of pleasure. So the senses should be controlled first. The enjoyments derived through the senses should be given up by the practice of discrimination and dispassion. This is the starting point of spiritual advancement. The Lord says to every seeker “Whatever other obstacles and difficulties there may be, look to this first. Control the senses. Other things shall follow later.” Therefore let every seeker examine the outgoing senses, and find out the objects towards which they are running. Then let him turn away from them by examining and understanding their filthy nature.",

    "commentary": "In the previous verses, sense-restraint is enjoined as the first condition of spiritual progress. But how to achieve it? The Lord answers it in this verse. Unless one stands above his enemy or acquires greater strength than the enemy, he cannot defeat him. So one should understand what the position of the senses is in the organism of the human being. No doubt the senses are superior to the bodily organs like hands and legs because they have a wider range of activity. But the mind is superior to the senses because it has a still wider range of activity and is endowed with higher powers of generating action. But the intellect is superior to the mind because the operations of the mind are subject to the dictates of the intellect which directs the mind in its various activities. But higher than the intellect and greater than all, stands Atma, the omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent, ever-blissful Self. The Self is All-mighty. Nothing can touch it or affect it. In the Sankhya Yoga, the Lord has already described the glory and indestructibility of Atma.",
