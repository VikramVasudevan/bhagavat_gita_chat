The man who renounces actions prompted by personal desire for enjoyment is practically a sannyasi, though he lives with his wife and children as a householder. Similarly, the man who abandons the fruits of actions is a Tyagi whatever may be his social position.",

    "translation": "Acts of sacrifice, charity, and austerity should not be abandoned; they should be performed indeed; sacrifice, charity, and austerity are purifiers for the thoughtful (who do not desire for fruits).",
    "commentary": "The Lord gives His decision on the problem (1)Na tyajyam:Acts of yajna, tapas and dana, should not be abandoned. (2)Karyam eva tat:they should be performed. ‘tyajyam’(should not be abandoned) implies `karyam eva’(should be performed). But the Lord emphasises His conclusion by putting it both in the negative and positive forms. We can understand how necessary these righteous acts are for the seekers of liberation. Sometimes we come across some philosophers and religious men who deny these acts on the ground that even good acts are a bondage and lead to further births. Their position is directly opposed to the Lord’s will. Righteous work of every kind is encouraged very frequently in the Gita. In this verse, the Lord warns not to abandon good acts like sacrifice, austerity and charity. He commands that they should be performed. Why should there be any doubt and why should man go down into lower planes by ignoring the Lord’s command? Performed without longing for the fruits, these good works purify the mind and lead to Atmajnana. There is no other way.",

    "translation": "Verily these acts should be performed leaving aside attachment (doership) and the fruits; this is my certain and best opinion.",
    "commentary": "The Lord here explains how acts of yajna, dana and tapas should be performed. The principle is that the performer should give up the idea of doership and abandon any desire to enjoy the fruits of work.These two evils (1) the feeling ‘I am the doer’, and (2) ‘I will get this reward for my doing this work’ – bind man to the wheel of birth and death.They cause bondage. Therefore, the true seekers should learn to conduct these sacrifices, charities and austerities with a pure heart, giving up everything to the Lord. They attain liberation (Moksha). The Lord declares that this His decision is the ‘best’. Thus inspired by the Lord, let mankind act to His command and attain the Highest.",

    "commentary": "The duties of man prescribed by the Sastras are intended for the uplift and welfare of mankind in their moral and spiritual life. So, they should not be abandoned. To renounce them by delusion is wrong. When the mind of the Jiva is overcast by the clouds of ignorance such thoughts like abandoning Sastraic injunctions come to him. The Lord has already declared that the Sastras are, the authority about what ought to be done and what ought not to be done (17-28). Whatever May be the cause, ignorance, negligence, or laziness abandoning the obligatory acts of the Sastras is Tamasic Tyaga.",

    "translation": "He who abandons obligatory duties from fear of bodily discomfort, as painful (to the body), thus does Tamasic renunciation and obtains not the fruit of renunciation.",
    "commentary": "If the Tamasic Tyagi abandons action by ignorance, the Rajasic tyagi does so from fear of bodily discomfort. He is lazy and the dullness of the body overpowers him, preventing him from doing the practices. It is true that action which is ultimately beneficial is at first difficult to follow. So, the man of weak will-power neglects it from sheer fear of bodily pain. He renounces them as useless or beyond his power to practice. To get up at the auspicious time of Brahmamuhurta (4 A.M.), taking a good bath in cold water in the river or from a well, practising the vow of celibacy, and such other methods may appear difficult in the beginning, but in the long run, they yield the highest reward of joy and happiness, health and strength. The Rajasic Tyagi is foregoing a great good for a slight cause. Such is the power of the flesh over the spirit. We find that every great man in any field has mastered the body and made it a simple instrument for useful work. To abandon obligatory duties on account of bodily pain is nothing short of sacrificing the spirit for the sake of the body.",

    "translation": "“This ought to be done as prescribed by the Sastras” – thus knowing, whatsoever work is done without attachment and desire for fruit, that renunciation is regarded as Sattvic.",
    "commentary": "From this verse, one should clearly understand that renunciation of attachment and desire for fruit, is Sattvic renunciation, and not certainly the abandoning of obligatory duties. The word ‘karyam’ is used to show that prescribed sastraic duties ought to be performed. The ignorant man neglects them from delusion, and the Rajasic man abandons them from fear of bodily pain. The Sattvic man understands the real value of the duties prescribed in the Sastras, and performs them in spite of bodily discomfort, without a sense of doership, without attachment for their rewards. This type of renunciation is true Tyaga, and by such Tyaga, man attains purity and liberation.",

He does not abandon an action because it is painful nor does he immerse himself in action because it is pleasing and agreeable to him. When it is said that he has no aversion to desireful or painful actions, it does not mean that he loves them. He is just indifferent to them like the Jivanmukta, and carries the prescribed duties without any attachment for their fruits. He has no sense of doership, and he is not contaminated by them.",

Therefore, working without concern for any reward flowing from it, is the best method of life. He is not bound by action. He alone is called the real Tyagi.We understand clearly that Tyaga definitely means the renunciation of the fruits of action and not the actions.There should not be any sense of doership; there should not be any secret longing to enjoy the fruits of work. No one can be a tyagi by simply giving up work, nor can he obtain the merit of renunciation. Performing all works and yet being unconcerned with fruits is the characteristic feature of the true Tyagi. Abandoning external objects is not Tyaga. The abandoning of the mental attitude, the internal thought of enjoyment, is the ‘sine quo non’ of true Tyaga. Therefore, the Lord’s command is to carry out all prescribed duties in a selfless detached spirit.",

The word ‘kritante’ is used in the sense that when the knowledge of the Self arises, all actions terminate. In the Vedanta Sastra, (in the Upanishads), Atma is declared to be distinct from and transcending Prakriti, and all actions are performed by Prakriti only, and Atma remains as the eternal witness. The Vedanta is the termination of all Karma. “Sarvam Karmakhilam Partha Jnane Parisamapyate” With the knowledge of the Self all actions come to end, all Karma culminates in jnana. When the Atmic state is realised, the mind, senses and the body cease to exist, and so there cannot be any action whatsoever. That state is beyond Karma. Action can take place only at the lower planes of body and mind. When they are transcended by Atma-jnana, action automatically comes to an end. That is the reason why the word ‘Kritanta’ is used for the Vedanta Sastra, which teaches Atmajnana.",

    "translation": "This being so, (the five factors being the cause of all Karma) whoever, on account of untrained understanding, thinks the Self as the doer, he, the man of perverted intelligence, does not know the truth about the nature of Atma or the nature of Karma.",
    "commentary": "The Self is not the doer of any action. The five above-mentioned factors are the causes of all action. The Self is witness, one, without any vehiclesupadhis, detached from everything, matter, speech and thought. The Lord describes the ignorant man who imagins self to be the doer, by the attributes ‘akrita buddi‘ and ‘durmati‘. His understanding is confused because he has not trained it to comprehend the truth by the study of the Sastras. He is a man of perverted intelligence(durmati). Learning and scholarship mastery of all worldly sciences and arts do not confer Atmajnana, and so they remain in the realm of ‘Avidya’ and cannot perceive the truth of Atma. They are blind, having eyes; they are perversed having intelligence; they are men of little understanding, having read many things in the world. They are groping in darkness, in spite of all the light that they have gathered about the world. The Self is not understood by them. Atmajnana alone clears all the doubts and perversities of the body and mind. Nothing can take man beyond Samsara exçept Self-realisation. All the name and fame that man acquires is so much rubbish compared to the realisation of truth, for truth alone confers true joy, freedom and perfection. The Lord is pleased with those who strive to know the Truth. To win popularity among fellow beings is an ordinary thing, and to win the grace of God is a higher achievement.",

This knowledge is the cause of all friction and conflict everywhere. When mankind is separated by religion, race, nationality, and political doctrines, the result is conflict as we see it everywhere in the world. This knowledge is not knowledge, because it does not enable one to see the underlying unity of all beings. The Advaitic vision of the universal existence of Atma is the true vision, and it is this vision only that can put an end to all frictions and conflicts in the world. So long as man is contented with Rajasic knowledge and thinks of it as the only knowledge available for mankind, the world would be torn asunder by conflicting elements fighting for superiority and supremacy over one another.",

Half-digested notions, fanciful theories, personal likes and dislikes, are nowadays taken as basic truths by individual members of society. Independent judgment has come down to the level of personal feelings of men who are subject to a hundred vile passions and prejudices. So, without deluding oneself by clinging to his own views, notions, and opinions, men should act according to the Sastras, as the Sastras embody the combined wisdom of sages who have gone beyond ‘raga’ and dvesha’, and whose only aim is to work for the welfare of humanity.",

The mind, the vital forces, the external and internal instruments of the body, should be held, and controlled, by unswerving Yogic concentration. This is Sattvic Dhriti’. The yogi is determined to conquer the whole of the inner universe and keep it under his control. He draws the mind back from the innumerable temptations of the sense-enjoyment; he frees himself from the tremendous delusion of the objective universe. This is Sattvic courage and firmness. Besides worldly courage which helps man to overcome external difficulties and dangers, one should cultivate firmness of Yoga in the conquest of the internal forces.",

Many people ask the question-“How can we realise Atma, transcend pain and suffering, and attain bliss”? The Lord answers the question here. “Practice, and you shall attain that state,” says the Lord. Nothing can be achieved by mere talk and mere study of books. You can get butter only by churning the curd. You can get sweet juice only by crushing the sugar cane.

The aspirant should never forget that the pain which he is enduring will yield the richest and the most plentiful joy in the end. So he should remain strong and determined and should not waver in continuing his sadhana. The pain is like poison, and certainly not poison (visham iva). The struggle with the impure tendencies accumulated in innumerable past births would be naturally severe and painful, but the pain is only apparent and not real. This should be clearly kept in mind so that the seeker is not depressed by the painful experience of self-discipline in the early stages of the sadhana.The struggle is inevitable. It is a part of spiritual life and no one can hope to attain the highest without going through the conflict between the lower and higher natures. But one can rest assured that the higher nature is the real power behind everything and so it shall come out victorious at the end, however deep-rooted the impure vasanas might be in the mind of the Sadhaka.The apparent pain of self-denial is only the prelude to the attainment of Brahmananda.",

Here again, the Lord states that the difference among the castes is due to qualities differently exhibited according to their nature. So, the accident of birth is not the real criterion to fix the special gradation of the caste system. It shows that caste is no bar for anyone who aspires for Self-realisation. Though the birth is apparently in the lower castes, man can ascend to great spiritual heights by the purity of his character and conducts. The Gita thus throws open the gates of Brahmajnana to all people who are qualified for it by virtue of their inherent predispositions and acquired merit. The accident of birth is of very little significance.",

    "translation": "Better is one’s own duty though destitute of merits or incomplete than the duty of another well performed; the man who performs action ordained by his own nature does not incur sin.",
    "commentary": "The Lord declares that one should not give up his prescribed duty though it appears difficult to perform it fully and completely. The duties of another man appear easy and attractive, but the true seeker should stick to his own method and way of life. This is certainly better than abandoning one’s own duty and taking up another’s and doing it even meritoriously. We have to refer this statement to Arjuna’s original plea to abandon fighting and to live the life of a mendicant. Arjuna is a Kshatriya and his duty born of his own nature is to fight. He should not give up this duty. He should perform it in the true spirit of a Karma-Yogi. By doing so, he does not incur sin. The principle holds good to all men engaged in various forms of work each according to his nature.",

Therefore all action is attended with some form of evil or other. All action is ‘Anatma’; it is objective, and it is corrupted by Gunas, so all action partakes of evil. Fire is enveloped by smoke. There can be no fire without the covering evil of smoke. In spite of it, one should not abandon the duty to which he is born, because if it is performed with detachment and in a spirit of surrender to the Lord, it purifies the mind and leads to liberation.",

Though a man is engaged in the activities of the world with all the senses functioning continuously, if he remembers the Lord or if he surrenders the fruits of his works to the Lord, he obtains the grace of Iswara and liberation comes to him easily. From this, we understand the action performed with true devotion leads man to a state of supreme Bliss. He who takes refuge in the Lord is not bound by any action or by all the actions done continually throughout his life. On the other hand, he breaks the bonds of Karma, for, the binding power of Karma is destroyed by true devotion to the Lord. There is no agency or selfish desire behind such work. Such is of the state of the true devotee whose mind is centered in the Lord and who feels that it is the power of the Lord which is functioning through him. When that attitude of mind is firmly established, man feels not the weight of work, nor the changes of fortune, nor the anxieties of the future.",

The great secret behind all action is the sense of non-doership (i.e.) the absence of agency, in the doer. Man must act some way or other by the force of his nature and habit. How then can he be free from the binding effects of his action? The answer is this-By giving up the sense of doership, and renouncing the fruits of action he can be free. This is the essential secret behind all action. One who has attained this feeling of detachment is not bound by anything that he does.",

This is a truth that man thinks and acts according to his nature. If that is so, if man cannot but follow nature, how can there be any prospect of liberation? He was bound in the past and the same will bind him in the present and the future. Is there no way out? There is. The force of nature and human effort are both active forces in one’s life. However much he feels that he is bound by nature, there is the opposite current of thought pointing the way to liberation. The struggle between the two goes on endlessly in the human heart. The Divine Sankaras slowly unfold themeselves and as they become stronger, all the weaknesses of man are overcome in due course. There is no other way. Therefore every man, however, degraded he may be at present, must take an upward curve one time or other. The sooner it is done the better it is for man. But there is no cause for despair in this account. “Perseverance will finally conquer,” says Vivekananda.",

    "transliteration": "tam eva śharaṇaṁ gachchha sarva-bhāvena bhāratatat-prasādāt parāṁ śhāntiṁ sthānaṁ prāpsyasi śhāśhvatam",
    "word_by_word_meaning": "tam—unto him; eva—only; śharaṇam gachchha—surrender; sarva-bhāvena—whole-heartedly; bhārata—Arjun, the son of Bharat; tat-prasādāt—by his grace; parām—supreme; śhāntim—peace; sthānam—the abode; prāpsyasi—you will attain; śhāśhvatam—eternal",
    "translation": "O Arjuna! With your whole being, take refuge in the Lord; by His grace, you will obtain supreme peace and the eternal abode (i.e.) liberation.",
    "commentary": "It is said in the previous verse that man is bound to the wheel of Samsara by the power of Maya. What is the way to liberation? How can he attain supreme peace? The answer is given in this verse. To surrender with all his being, whole-heartedly to the Lord who dwells in all beings is the only way to attain freedom from the shackles of Samsara. If anybody wants to stop a machine he must seek the help of the mechanic. The Lord is the mechanic who holds and runs the tremendous machine of Samsara. Therefore Jiva has to take refuge in the Lord if he wants liberation. Without whole-hearted surrender to the Lord, the power of Maya will not give way. Only the power of the Lord is capable of terminating the power of Maya. To none else will Maya give way. Therefore the Lord advises Arjuna to surrender to Him with all his being. This exhortation is for all beings. It is the simplest and easiest path for everyone to follow.All physical powers are subject to the power of Maya and Maya is subject to the power of the Lord. Knowing this, man has to give up pride and egoism and take refuge in the Lord with humility and devotion.The same idea is expressed many times in many places in the Gita. This is one of the central ideas of the Scripture. That the idea of surrender is emphasised in the last verses of the scripture is sufficient proof that it is the major current of thought throughout. Arjuna surrendered to the Lord before the message of Gita is offered to him. The idea is once again brought into a focal point at the end.",

    "commentary": "The Lord describes the Gita-Sastra as the most secret of all knowledge. The teachings of this wisdom should be communicated only to such disciples who are qualified to receive it. Arjuna was qualified to receive it by virtue of his great devotion to Krishna, and the virtuous qualities (Daivisampat) that he possessed. Lord Krishna has thereby done a great service to mankind. Even for learning any worldly skill or art, a great deal of preparation is necessary for the student. When that is so, what amount of internal and external preparation is necessary for receiving this highest wisdom, one can easily understand. So the Lord declares that he has taught the most secret wisdom to Arjuna, just because he is fit to receive it, and finds it most necessary in the circumstances in which he is placed.",
