    "commentary": "The Lord at first taught the secret of `nishkama karma’ to the Sun, and through him, the Emperor – saints learned it. By the power of this Yoga, the mind is purified and the Self is realised. All those who practised this Yoga became sages and attained freedom and perfection. Though they may belong to different strata of society, rich or poor, all of them attained the highest reward of truth and perfection.",

    "commentary": "Royal sages -Kings who knew Brahmavidya are called royal sages. They are Jnanis as well as rulers, who possessed royalty and wisdom together. In the earliest times, several Kings and emperors were endowed with Self-Knowledge. The term `Rishi’ is a title. Anyone can acquire it. Even an ordinary man becomes a `Rishi’ when he comes to possess Atma vidya. So the man who conquers the senses and mind, who is able to practise nishkama karma, and who has attained a glimpse of the Supreme Self is a Rishi.",

But it is imperishable. When spiritual Dharma suffers decline, the Lord incarnates Himself to re-establish it. Great spiritual men like Sankara and others come into the world to reclaim the declining Dharma and re-establish it in the world. This same ancient knowledge is now taught to Arjuna by Lord Krishna.",

Still, it is quite possible that the supreme secret of the Lord’s incarnation might have appeared as a mystery to Arjuna, and he desired that the Lord Himself should unravel the mystery. Arjuna’s doubt is the doubt of all ordinary human beings, and so the Lord’s answer is intended to enlighten mankind about the mystery of His incarnation in the world.",

So when the laws of righteousness are violated and suppressed, the Lord has to manifest Himself to re-establish, Dharma. Otherwise, the universe falls to pieces. Men destroy themselves in a hundred ways. The whole scheme of creation will be disturbed and the very purpose of human existence is defeated. So the righteous way of life has to be kept clear and clean for humanity to tread the path of God – realisation. For that purpose, the Lord manifests Himself. Therefore whoever follows the Dharmic way of life is doing God’s work. Whoever defies the Dharma is the foe of the Lord, and he shall be destroyed by the Lord.",

    "commentary": "The essence of the Upanishadic declaration “Brahmavit Brahmaiva bhavati” is restated in this verse. One who knows Brahman becomes that. Between knowing and becoming, there is no distinction in Brahmavidya. It is different in the objective world; there the knower and the known are different. But in the realm of the Self, knowing and becoming are one. In other words, only he who knows Him becomes Brahman. But what is this knowing of Brahman? It is certainly not an intellectual conclusion, drawn by logic and argument from a study of the Sastras. One may be convinced by the logical argument that Brahman alone is real, and yet he may be far far away from realising Him. This is not knowledge of Brahman. Knowing Brahman means the direct experience of Atma which is beyond the body, senses mind and intellect. This is to know Brahman in the essence (Tattatah).",

Here Jnana is described as tapas, a penance of wonderful merit because it cleanses all accumulated sins of previous births and all the impurities of inherited instincts, impulses and tendencies. Such men who are purified by this penance are mentioned as purified (Putah). What are the marks of this Jnana tapas? Freedom from desire, fear and hatred, intense devotion and absorption in the Lord, seeking ultimate refuge in Him, – these are the aspects of Jnana tapas. What is its effect? Attaining the Lord, Self-realisation through purity is the reward.",

The purpose of devotion, its method and manner, and its intensity would determine the nature of the reward. God is like the wish-yielding plant of Paradise. What man wishes to obtain, that the Lord gives. The man who is suffering from bodily pain prays to be relieved of that pain, and the pain is relieved. The poor man wishes for wealth and prosperity, and God gives him these worldly benefits. The devotee yearns for the devotion and he gets that. The Jnani seeks for liberation and he attains Moksha. This is to say that different types of persons share the grace of God in different ways each according to his own samskaras. If men seek perishable worldly things, they get only those things and not Moksha. When we approach God, we should clearly know what we should seek. It would be absurd for a man to approach an Emperor and ask for a few vegetables. How foolish then would it be to approach God for worldly pleasures and enjoyments, instead of true knowledge and devotion! The wind of God’s grace is blowing everywhere and at all times. Let us keep the sails unfurled to catch the friendly breeze and make rapid progress in life’s voyage to the heaven of peace, light and blessedness. The lazy and ignorant sailors remain where they are, for they do not know that the wind of God’s grace is all-pervading and ever ready to help and guide all mankind.",

So men worship the Devas like Indra, Varuna etc., and offer sacrifices to them, and the fruits of such works are quickly attained and enjoyed. All the other worlds are places of enjoyment resulting from the work done here. The earth is the world of action (Karma Bhumi) for good or evil. Men attain Heaven or Hell according to the good or evil done by them in this world. When that experience is over, they take birth once again in this world.

Any kind of work, and any amount of it, cannot bind him. So what he does amounts to no action or inaction, just because he knows that he is not doing anything at all, but that the bodily and mental organs and instruments are functioning according to their nature in their own fields of activity. Let us take the illustration of a mirror. Various objects and various forms of action are reflected in it constantly, and yet the minor is not tainted in any way; it remains clear and pure. Even so, the Jnani knows that he is the all-pervading Self and in that Self all actions of the universe are taking place just like those reflected in the mirror. Thus we find that several sages and great men have done great good to mankind through detached and desireless action. Their action, from this point of view, is no action at all so far as they are concerned, as they have entered the Self – state beyond the physical and mental planes. The ignorant man may attribute action to him because he is confused and does not know the secret which the Jnani understands in all the actions. It is this philosophical position which is stated in this apparently paradoxical sentence.",

The man who has no desire to enjoy the pleasures of the objective world has his mind turned inwards in the contemplation of Atma. He finds all happiness there. So even though he works he cannot have any attachment for the fruits of work. Self-control leads to Atmajnana. When the senses and the mind are restrained, naturally man becomes free from the enticing temptation of the material world with all its glamour and attraction. When such a man works, he has no feeling of attachment for any material object at all. The third attribute `aparigraha‘ should be carefully noted by the aspirant. Non-receiving of gifts and possessions is enjoined by the Sastras as a very important discipline for the seeker. When one receives gifts from others he takes with them part of the karma of the giver. The very purpose of the seeker (i.e.) to get rid of karma is defeated. Why should he add to his own load the sins of others by receiving worthless possessions of material things? Non-receiving (Aparigraha) is therefore enjoined as the rule of conduct for all spiritual aspirants.",

Over-eating or under-eating, eating at all odd times, in all places, all types of food from all kinds of persons, – all these should be carefully avoided. It is food that is turned into physical energy which in its turn is turned into mental energy that leads to spiritual illumination. Impure food not only unhinges the physical body but also irritates and provokes all kinds of undesirable humours which are detrimental to self-control.
