    "commentary": "‘Kshetram‘ means field. The field is necessary for growing corn and other things to sustain the beings of the world. So also the body is necessary for the growth of the seed of knowledge in the heart of man. All ‘sadhana’, ‘tapas’, thinking and meditation – all this is to be done with the body. So the body, the ‘kshetra’, is the field for the growth of the, seed of ‘Dharma’ as well as ‘Jnana’. Therefore it is called ‘kshetra’.",

In theSecond Discoursein the verse‘Na tvevaham jatu nasam’(2.12), the Lord has already taught the Mahavakya, the highest truth. The Jiva is no other than Siva. The Jiva (really Pratyagatman) is the Knower of the field, the witness to the modifications of the body and mind, and this Jiva is not distinct from Paramatma, is actually one with Him. “Know Me as the Knower of the body in all the bodies”. So the Jiva who is the Knower in a particular body is Paramatma Himself, who is also the knower in everybody. There is therefore only one Knower and He is functioning in everybody as the witness. The Lord Himself is the Knower in all the bodies. The ‘Jiva’ is only a fictitious entity and has no real existence at all apart from the Lord. To know this Truth fully and finally is the highest achievement of man.",

    "commentary": "In this Discourse, both knowledge and the object of Knowledge are explained. The moral and spiritual qualities needed for Self-realisation are stated as Knowledge (Jnanam) here. Without perfect command of these qualities, no one can attain Paramatma. When the mirror is pure, the reflection is clear, not otherwise. Thus when the mind is purified by spiritual qualities, the Self is clearly reflected in it. So the seeker has to cultivate these qualities of jnanam first, and the self-existent Paramatman is revealed spontaneously without any effort on the part of man. All effort, all practice, all ‘sadhana’ is needed to purify the mind by the acquisition of these moral and spiritual qualities. There ends all effort. The Realisation of Paramatman occurs by itself. No effort is needed. Twenty spiritual qualities are mentioned here. The seeker has to understand each one of them and make them all part of his own personality.",

Therefore every seeker has to acquire God’s grace and Guru’s benediction by virtuous acts, by worship, by japa, tapas, by singing the name and glory of the Lord and by following all the aids to pure devotion. Then, out of compassion, He bestows on His Bhakta the ‘buddhiyoga‘ which enables him to distinguish the kshetra and kshetrajna. This knowledge leads him to become one with Paramatma (Madbhavaya). One may become a great scholar of the Sastras and Sciences, but he cannot obtain knowledge of the Divine if there is no devotion. Learning and realisation are entirely different. They are poles apart. Let the seekers move forward on the path of devotion, and let them gradually gain the intellectual purity to understand the final Truth. Moksha is the fruit of perfect knowledge of the kshetra and kshetrajna. And this knowledge is offered to the true devotee by the Lord Himself.",

This world also is of the same nature. It is beginningless. If one enters a mountain-cave full of darkness, he cannot say how long the darkness has been there. Therefore it is said that this Maya, Prakriti, is beginningless (anadi). No one can say when it began. But it has not been said that it is endless(anantam). If it is endless also, no one can cross over. Maya has no beginning, but it has an end. The moment knowledge dawns on man, it ends. The illusion is shattered, the moment Truth is seen. The dream-world may be beginningless, but the moment one wakes up it is all gone. True Knowledge then removes delusion forever. So Prakriti has no beginning but has an end; Purusha is beginningless and endless. He is eternal.",

    "commentary": "‘Karyam’ means the body; ‘Karanam’ means the senses, mind and ego, the five elements, and the objects of the sense-world. Prakriti is the cause, (i.e.) all these things are produced by Prakriti. So Prakriti is the cause of these things. Prakriti is inert (Jada) and so cannot have the power of experiencing joy and sorrow. Purusha is pure consciousness. So He cannot be subject to joy and sorrow. But by the senses of Prakriti, the Purusha appears to be experiencing these modifications of joy and sorrow. Really Purusha does not cause anything nor does anything affect Him in any way. He is neither cause nor effect, neither the modifications nor the experiencer of them.",

    "commentary": "This verse explains the cause for the birth of the Jiva in good and evil wombs. The cause for it is the attachment of the Jiva with qualities (sattva, rajas and tamas) and the various objects of the material world. This is the cause of bondage though the Jiva (Purusha) is really the Drik (seer), yet he is deluded into thinking that he is the objective body, and by the delusion, he attaches himself to the objective world through a sense of ‘I’ and ‘mine’, through ‘raga’ and ‘dvesha’. Thus he becomes bound and takes birth after birth in the world. He becomes a ‘samsari’ by binding himself to ‘samsara’. Therefore the wise man should know that attachment to the Gunas is the cause of birth and all the evils arising from it. He should cut off all contact with the Gunas, and the vehicle of the body; and he should not have any feeling of ‘myness’, regarding the body and its modifications. He should positively contemplate that He is ever free, pure consciousness, till by such contemplation, he releases himself from the shackles of the body and the Gunas relating to it. He then knows what he really is the eternally pure and perfect Purusha. This is the only way to go beyond the ocean of samsara, the series of births and deaths which one suffers. Attahment is bondage, detachment is freedom.",

He is the spectator of the body, mind and their modifications. Therefore the ‘jiva‘ should meditate continuously that he is not at all the body and mind but Atma. By the very force of that meditation, he regains his original state as Atma. In truth, the jiva is no other than Atma. He is deluded into thinking that he is the body which he never was and which he never can be. This deluded thinking should be given up once and for all, and man should assert himself to be Atma which he really is.",

In fact, this amounts to suicide (Atmahatya). The Lord shows how the ignorant man, thinking of himself as the non-Self, is destroying his true Self. Generally, what does the common man see and think? He sees the body and the world externally, си and thinks that he is the body. What happens then? The true Self is as good as having been destroyed because its existence is not known or realised. The wise man sees and realises the true Self, and so the does not care for the death of the body and the other vehicles covering the Atma. He knows that he is the immortal Self. But the ignorant not knowing this go through the wheel of suffering and death endlessly. They take birth after birth and die again and again.

No. Like ether, it is subtle; that is what is meant by the comparison. Ether pervades the sky, the dust, the mire and so on, and yet it is not tainted because it is subtle. Similarly, Atma pervades the whole body, and yet it is not tainted or affected by the birth and death of the body nor by the pleasures and pains of the mind or by anything taking place through the different vehicles (upadhis). Moreover, though storm-clouds burst into a thunder, lightning and rain, and spread out in different colours yet the sky is not tainted by the cold winds and hail storm. So also, Atma is seated firm and unmovable in the body and whatever changes take place in the body and mind, it is not at all touched by them in any way whatsoever.
