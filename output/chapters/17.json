    "word_by_word_meaning": "arjunaḥ uvācha—Arjun said; ye—who; śhāstra-vidhim—scriptural injunctions; utsṛijya—disregard; yajante—worship; śhraddhayā-anvitāḥ—with faith; teṣhām—their; niṣhṭhā—faith; tu—indeed; kā—what; kṛiṣhṇa—Krishna; sattvam—mode of goodness; āho—or; rajaḥ—mode of passion; tamaḥ—mode of ignorance",
    "translation": "Arjuna said: When men sacrifice to the gods with faith but discard the injunctions of the scriptures, what is the nature of their devotion, Ο Krishna? Is it sattva, rajas, or tamas?",
    "commentary": "It was declared that action contrary to Sastraic commands cannot lead to perfection (16.23&16.24). But there are people who have not read the Sastras either by indifference or incompetence or other reasons, and yet who believe in a higher power and carry on some form of worship and perform sacrifices. These men are different from the demonical type because the latter entirely denies the existence of the Higher power. These people have faith, but it is not in conformity with the Sastras. What is their condition? What is the nature of their worship? This is Arjuna’s question.",

    "commentary": "The mind (the inner organ) is alone the Jiva (man). So if the mind is pure, purity becomes the essence of that man. Here the word ‘sattva‘ means mind. Every individual acquires that nature which he has brought with him from his experience in former births. And his faith takes on that quality only. He is that faith, qualified by his Samskaras. So it is the duty of man to instill Sattvic disposition into his character and by practice transcend that also to reach the highest state. The Tamasic and Rajasic kinds of Sraddha should be abandoned, because they also pull man downwards into lower forms of existence. Among the qualities, Sattva is the nearest to Atma, and in Suddha-sattva, man directly perceives Atma, and enters the Nirguna state. That is the real Self of man, that is his final goal.",

In spiritual sadhana, food is of great importance, because the mind is formed by the food that is taken. Pure food develops the pure mind, and the pure mind easily grasps the spiritual truth.

It is not a negligible matter as some indulgent people imagine. It should be within the experience of everyone that when impure and offensive food is taken the mind immediately reacts by generating sensual tendencies, irritability, anger etc. If men take a little more care about their food and its regulation, not only will they be more healthy and happy, but they will also gain insight into the subtler truths of the spiritual realm. Such being the importance of food, the Lord first prescribes the type of food which is dear to the Sattvic type of men.",

Therefore it is said here that the Yajna should be ‘vidhidrishtah‘. Moreover it should be decided after deep consideration whether to perform the sacrifice or not, according to time, place and other circumstances. Above all this, it should be performed without any selfish motive. It should be an act of Nishkama karmayoga. Such Yagna is called Sattvic.Here the word ‘Yajna’ does not mean sacrifice of animals and other living beings. It refers to all charitable and beneficient acts of a divine character. Any good done in that spirit becomes a Yajna.",

    "commentary": "The principle of Nishkamakarma is once again emphasised here. The Rajasic man performs these sacrifices with a view to get some worldly reward. And also, he hopes to win name and fame by such acts of merit. Thus the Yajna loses its purity and divinity by the attachment and pretension of the doer. Any work if it should yield spiritual benefit should be done free from desire and free from pride and self-conceit. The Rajasic spirit should be annihilated. Then the same work becomes Sattvic.",

It is Vedanta brought down to the plane of practical work in the world. That is why the elders have prescribed distribution of food as an important item on all auspicious and holy occasions. Poor-feeding, respectful offering of food to deserving people, is an aspect of spiritual Sadhana, if its spirit is properly understood and kept in mind.

Otherwise, common failures and well-known obstacles in the way, might shake the will of the seeker and make him unfit for further effect. Highest faith in the Supreme is needed. When once the final goal is accepted and fixed in the mind, no obstacle can shake him from the path of spiritual advancement. He marches onwards and onwards, unmindful of failures and backslidings, till the light is revealed.",

Thus we can imagine the holiness of these acts. They are ‘Sat’. Moreover, all auspicious acts done for the sake of the Supreme are also named ‘Sat’. All such acts of inner purification, lead to the same goal-Brahman. In this manner, Brahman whose form is existence (isness) (Sat) is to be realised by these acts which are also called ‘Sat’. The condition to be carefully noted is that these acts should be performed for the sake of that Brahman, renouncing the fruits to God, and with no motive of personal gain. Then only they are ‘Sat’ and lead to Tat (That). Otherwise, the plane of action does not change. They are just like the hundred and one other actions that are usually done for personal profit and bind them to the wheel of Samsara.Action in itself cannot bind. It binds when one is attached to its fruits and desire to enjoy worldly benefits through them.Then they are not ‘Sať’, because they are practised for the sake of the world (Asat) and not for the sake of Brahman (Sat). The Lord teaches the Divinity of action in this verse. Knowing this, the seekers of truth should perform the best forms of action like Yajna, Tapas and Dana, with the ultimate aim of realising Brahman and attaining perfection and freedom.",

    "commentary": "Faith (sraddha) is the Key-note of success either in worldly life or in spiritual life. Without it, nothing is achieved even in small matters concerning everyday life. In spiritual life where man tries to ascend to the highest state the need for unswerving faith is greatly emphasised. That is why the Lord insists on faith in many places and He has devoted a whole Discourse to elaborate on the theme of faith (sraddha). Whatever may be the act performed by either Yajna or Dana or Tapas, or other good works, If there is no faith in the heart of the doer, it becomes utterly useless. It does not acquire the status of ‘Sat’. It is just ‘Asat’ (i.e.) something equal to zero, something not performed at all. Such acts bring no good either here or hereafter. A person may gather all materials for preparing food, and yet, if the cook has no ‘sraddha‘ in what he is doing, the whole thing goes to waste. So also, in the spiritual field, whatever other qualities the aspirants may possess, if he is void of faith, his austerities, sacrifices and charities bear no fruit at all. It remains only in the realm of the ‘Asat’ and cannot be transformed into ‘Sat’. Therefore it is the duty of all seekers to do their ‘sadhana’ with faith and realise the goal. Even a little of such ‘sadhana’ with faith will help to realise the Self. And such ‘sadhana’ does not at all go in vain. Thus, holding on to faith as the support, propelling force, and guiding light, man has to march forward towards the ultimate reality, the supreme Brahman.",
