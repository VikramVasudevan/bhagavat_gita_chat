    "commentary": [
      "The Lord was pleased to find that Arjuna, like a true disciple, was diligently listening to His words, most delighted with the teaching of the Divine Master. So the Lord proceeds to declare more and more of his divine power even before he asks for it. Such would be the love of the Master of a true disciple. As the Master finds the disciple in a receptive mood, full of faith and diligence, he reveals more of the Royal Secret out of the fulness of His heart. That is why the Lord says “delighting in my words” (“Priyamanaya’), referring to Arjuna’s absorption in His teaching. Arjuna’s doubt and grief were disappearing fast as the Lord continued to speak. The Lord knew it. So he speaks with a mightier accent and reveals more of His Divine Yoga. Again (Bhuyah) the Lord repeats and emphasises His universality and the hearer understands it, thinks of it and meditates on it. Repeated hearing of the Truth, constant thinking of it, and continuous meditation on it – this is the only way to absorb the Truth and make it one’s own.Vivekananda says: “This Atman is first to be heard of. Hear day and night that you are that Soul. Repeat it to yourself day and night till it enters into your very veins, till it tingles in every drop of blood, till it is in your flesh and bone.” Such should be the immovable firmness of conviction in the Divine Truth. So the Lord repeats, expounds, declares, and proclaims His Divine Glory.",

    "commentary": [
      "Among living beings of the world, man is the highest incarnation and among mortals, he who knows the Lord as unborn and beginningless is the greatest. Paramatma is unborn (ajah) and He has no beginning (anadi). All other beings have a beginning and end. They are born in time and die in time. Knowledge of Paramatma alone confers immortality on man. He becomes free from delusion. This indeed is the highest reward which man can get by his devotion to the Lord. All other worldly benefits are impermanent and illusory. They lead to sorrow and death. So it is the primary duty of all seekers to hold on to the Lord and transcend delusion with His grace. When delusion is gone, man is at once freed from all sin. When man becomes sinless he becomes one with Paramatma. Though a man is burdened with all the sins in the world, yet, like fire burning up a vast forest, God’s grace destroys the entire sin. So, devotion to the Lord is what is most essential. And his devotion is cultivated, strengthened, and developed by understanding the infinite Glory of the Lord. As man thinks constantly of the inscrutable power of the Lord, his adoration increases, and his worship becomes truer, deeper, and broader.",
      "A DEVOTEE:“Sir, is there no help, then, for such a worldly person?”",
      "MASTER:“Certainly there is. From time to time he should live in the company of holy men, and from time to time go into solitude to meditate on God. Furthermore, he should practise discrimination and pray to God, ‘Give me faith and devotion.’Once a person has faith he has achieved everything. There is nothing greater than faith.",
      "(To Kedar) “You must have heard about the tremendous power of faith. It is said in the Purana that Rama, who was God Himself — the embodiment of Absolute Brahman — had to build a bridge to cross the sea to Ceylon. But Hanuman, trusting in Rama’s name, cleared the sea in one jump and reached the other side. He had no need of a bridge. (All laugh.) “Once a man was about to cross the sea. Bibhishana wrote Rama’s name on a leaf, tied it in a corner of the man’s wearing-cloth, and said to him: ‘Don’t be afraid. Have faith and walk on the water. But look here — the moment you lose faith you will be drowned.’ The man was walking easily on the water. Suddenly he had an intense desire to see what was tied in his cloth. He opened it and found only a leaf with the name of Rama written on it. ‘What is this?’ he thought. ‘Just the name of Rama!’ As soon as doubt entered his mind he sank under the water.",
      "“If a man has faith in God, then even if he has committed the most heinous sins — such as killing a cow, a brahmin, or a woman — he will certainly be saved through his faith. Let him only say to God, ‘O Lord,! will not repeat such an action’, and he need not be afraid of anything.”(BG 10.3,BG 4.36,BG 9.32,BG 18.66)",
      "When he had said this, the Master sang:",
      "If only I can pass away repeating Durga’s name,How canst Thou then, O Blessed One,Withhold from me deliverance,Wretched though I may be?I may have stolen a drink of wine, or killed a child unborn,Or slain a woman or a cow,Or even caused a brahmin’s death;But, though it all be true,Nothing of this can make me feel the least uneasiness;For through the power of Thy sweet nameMy wretched soul may still aspireEven to Brahmanhood.

    "commentary": [
      "Sixteen good qualities and four bad qualities are mentioned in these two verses. All these qualities proceed from the Lord Himself. What does this mean? It does not mean that God gives good qualities to some people and bad qualities to others. He has already declared “There is no one hateful or dear to Me.” This being so, the qualities exhibited by different people are the result of their own thoughts and actions. Men who contemplate the righteous become good, possessing all divine qualities, and others who think and act in the opposite direction becomes bad, possessing undivine qualities. It is by the Lord’s power that these qualities, good and bad come to man, though the Lord is just a witness only and is not affected by them. The Lord does not cause karma. He is not the doer of karma, (‘karmakarta‘). He is the dispenser of the fruits of the action (‘karmaphalapradata‘). It is in this sense that we have to understand the Lord’s declaration.",
      "Moreover, the mind is in itself insentient, and it is animated by the life-force of the Lord. As the iron-needle moves by the nearness of the magnet, the presence of Atma makes the mind active according to its own nature. Therefore the Lord here says that from Him arise all the different qualities of mortals. Indeed Atma (the Lord) does not cause them nor prompt them. The Sun has nothing to do with the actions of mortals in the world, nor has the theatre-light anything to do with the actions performed on the stage.",

      "The Lord declares that the Seven great Rishis, the four ancient Devarshis, the fourteen Manus, were all born of the divine samkalpa, partaking of His nature. These indeed are the original ancestors and the creators of this world. They are all devotees of the Lord, possessing perfect Atmajnana.",

They are the highest devotees and perfected beings, (i.e) they are jnanis of the highest order, who possess direct knowledge of Brahman. They know the highest Truth. All the beings of the world, are the progeny of these great souls. They partake of the nature of God, and all others partake of the nature of these Divine manifestations. Should not people then be full of devotion and wisdom? Is it not a denial of one’s heritage and birthright to entangle himself in the bonds of the objective world and get lost in the wilderness of Samsara? People remember their sage-ancestors when they perform their morning and evening ablutions (Sandhyavandanam). It is a reminder to all that like their ancestors they should rise to the plane of the spirit. Ancestral property, wealth, power, and possessions, do not save men from destruction if they forget the Divinity in them and sink in the mire of ignorance and delusion. It is the ancient wisdom alone that could save man from sorrow and death.",
      "Let people be filled with this great idea that they have for their ancestors the great sages, Devarshis and Manus. Let them share the devotion and wisdom of their Divine forefathers. No one should think that he is low-born and weak. The blood of the Divine fore-fathers is flowing in everybody’s veins, irrespective of his caste and faith. So let one demand his birthright of devotion and knowledge. It is not the personal possession of anyone. All beings have right over that Divine knowledge. The outcastes as well as people of the highest rank and position possess the same right to wisdom and perfection. The Lord has proclaimed the Divine birth-right of all men. So if one should be asked to declare his ancestry, let him say boldly that he is the child of the great Rishis and Manus. If anybody thinks he is low-born, he degenerates into a vile man. If he thinks that he is pure and perfect, he does become the real child of the ancient Masters. Therefore, may all beings remember their holy fore-fathers every day, and by acquiring their great qualities, break the shackles of bondage and enjoy perfect peace and joy.",
      "Among the above-mentioned, the Devarshis (Sanaka Sanandana, Sanatkumara, Sanatsujata) taught the path of the withdrawal from worldly life (Nivrithimarga). The fourteen Manus taught the path of Dharma, righteous conduct of life (Pravrittimarga). The first belongs to the line of the Gurus, and the second to the line of the ancestors. All these are brought forth from the Supreme Being, by a wish (samkalpa) of His mind. So ultimately all are the children of the Lord and He is the father of all.

      "There are many who repeat God’s name, serve Him, and meditate on Him. But very few are capable of pure devotion born of true realisation that He is the source of all things. Pure devotion is therefore the result of real understanding of the creative power of the Lord and His wonderful manifestation.Without understanding how the Lord is present in the universe, it is difficult to cultivate true faith, and without faith pure devotion is not possible.When man knows that the Lord is the final cause of everything, and that there is nothing else but He in all things, he spontaneously offers worship to Him.

But the real devotee consecrates his body, mind and life to the Lord. His mind thinks of the Lord; his limbs do the work of the Lord; his eyes see the Lord; his reason understands the presence of the Lord everywhere. His whole life is thus absorbed in the Lord. His whole life is a continued worship. When the devotees meet together they only talk of God, His power, and Yoga. God’s glory is infinite. Everywhere, in everything, God’s power is manifesting itself. So the devotee goes on thinking and speaking of God’s Glory. Such holy company is the highest spiritual education that man can get. All doubts are cleared by mutual enlightenment. There is a powerful current, spiritual thought, and emotion, circulating among them. The very air they breathe is full of knowledge and bliss.",

      "The devotees feel satisfied and delighted. The contemplation of the Divine is an end in itself, and joy derived from it is pure and perfect. When a person begins to feel this joy which is unlike any other sensual pleasure, he finds no attraction for anything else. He sings the name of the Lord in ecstatic joy, he laughs, he speaks out of the fullness of joy, and gets himself lost in divine intoxication. For him, the whole world is transfigured and defined. He sees the Lord everywhere and he sees nothing other than the Lord anywhere.",
      "The devotee’s life is dedicated and consecrated to the Lord. His one and only aim is to know the Lord and be with Him. He is ready to sacrifice his life for realising his aim. Such a resolute spirit is necessary for God-realisation. Life is nothing if God is not realised. We find great idealists giving up everything for attaining their ideal. So also the believers in God are ready to give up their life in their effort to reach Him. Lukewarm-faith does not lead to the goal quickly. The sacrifice should be complete and unconditional. Then the Lord is pleased, and immortality is attained. That is why it is said“tyagennike amritatvamanasuh.”– by sacrifice alone, immoratality is obtained. Great souls surrender their all to the Lord.",
      "This verse gives a vivid picture of the daily life and work of the devotee dedicated to the realisation of the Supreme.",
      "Sri Ramakrishna was encouraging Nanda.MASTER (to Nanda):“Though you are a householder, still you have kept your mind on God. Is that a small thing? The man who has renounced the world will pray to Him as a matter of course. Is there any credit in that? But blessed indeed is he who, while leading a householder’s life, prays to God. He is like a man who finds an object after removing a stone weighing twenty maunds.“One should pray to God, establishing with Him an appropriate relationship. Hanuman’s love for God was mixed with knowledge; but Narada’s love for God was pure and unadulterated.“Rama asked Hanuman, ‘Hanuman, what attitude do you cherish toward Me when you worship Me?’ Hanuman answered: ‘Sometimes I see that You are the whole and I am a part; sometimes I see that You are the Master and I am Your servant. But Rama, when I have the Knowledge of Reality, then I find that You are I and I am You.’“Rama said to Narada, ‘Ask a favour of Me.’ Narada said, ‘O Rama, grant me the boon that I may have genuine love for Thy Lotus Feet and that I may not come under the spell of Thy world-bewitching maya!'” (Source:Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna)",

    "commentary": [
      "This is one of the key verses in the Gita, in which the link between bhakti and jnana, devotion and knowledge, is clearly stated. Bhakti, Jnana that is the natural order of evolution in Self-realisation. The Lord declares that to those who are ever devoted to Him in love, He gives ‘buddhi yoga‘-the yoga of discrimination and wisdom by which they come unto Him.",
      "Brahmajnana is the gift of the Lord. The realisation of the Jiva that Brahman alone is and that he is no other than Brahman, is Brahmajnana. This knowledge is in the hands of God, and it can be obtained by means of loving and faithful worship. When the Lord is pleased with His devotee, He bestows Brahmajnana which unites the devotee and the Lord forever and ever. So Bhakti is the first step in spiritual evolution for all seekers. When we come across rare men who are born with Brahmajnana, it should be understood that they have spent many many lives in pure and loving devotion to the Lord.",
      "Here two great qualities of the devotee are mentioned (1) steadfastness in devotion (2) worshipping with love.",
      "(1) Continuous memory of the Lord is essential. How can the devotee have continuous memory of the Lord? This Discourse shows the way. The manifold manifestations of the Lord are vividly presented to fill the imagination of the devotee. Wherever he turns, the Lord is there in one form or other. If one recalls to his mind theverses 7 to 11 in the Seventh Discourse, and verses16 to 19 in the Ninth Discourse, and the whole of the Vibhuti yoga, he understands the universal manifestation of the Lord everywhere. So the devotee should recognise the Lord’s presence everywhere and thus the devotion becomes continuous in course of time.",
      "(2) Loving worship of the Lord is another attribute of devotees. Is not the Lord the friend of all beings? Though he is the sovereign of all the worlds. He is at the same time a friend of all. He declares Himself to be a friend again and again. Does He not say to Arjuna ‘you are dear to Me’? What then should be man’s love and affection for the Lord? Such love is needed, and since God’s love is infinite, no one should feel that His grace has not descended on him. Knowing full well from experience and observation that the foolish little things to which one is desperately clinging are vanishing into nothing, let the seeker have love for the Lord who is the only saviour from all the sorrows and miseries of life.",
      "Buddhiyogam:What is Buddhiyoga? It is reason (vichara), the path of uncompromising discrimination between the Real and the unreal, between Atma and Anatma. Such analytical reasoning ultimately leads the seeker to the tremendous conclusion that his limited self manifesting as ‘I’ is nothing else but the Supreme Brahman. The ‘I’ dissolves in Brahman, even as a waterdrop merges in the ocean. Such discriminative reason is the gift of God. Reason (vichara) leads man step by step to the ultimate Reality. He who is firmly established in this Yoga holds on only to the essence of things (asti, bhati, priva) and does not recognise name and form (nama, rupa).",
      "Several doubts crop up in the mind of the devotee in the course of his daily worship. “When shall I get true knowledge of Atma which is said to be within the five sheaths (panchakosa? I am only worshipping the external image, a picture or idol. Is this God? God is said to be Sachidananda. Of what use is it to offer fruits and flowers at the altar of a mute earthen or mental image? When shall my worship bear fruit in the realisation of God? When shall the mind turn within and see the Lord in essence in my heart ?” Such questions arise in the mind of all worshippers. The answer is given in this verse. The Lord says, “O mortal being! continue your worship of Me in the image or idol which pleases you most. Think of My form, beautiful and perfect, love Me as the repository of all noble qualities, as the Lord of the World. Let your mind be saturated with My thoughts and feelings. Give up all foolish thoughts of ‘I’ and ‘mine’ which bind you to the body and the world. Be devoted to Me. Then I will bestow on you the light of knowledge which will lead you directly to Brahmajnana. Your spiritual quest ends there.” So says the Lord to all sincere and eager devotees.",
      "Thus Bhakti evolves into Jnana. If Bhakti is the flower, jnana is the fruit.",
      "God with form (Sakara) is also God without form (Nirakara). God with attributes (Saguna) is also God without attributes (Nirguna). The transition from the Sakara to the Nirakara takes place spontaneously by the will of the Lord. The Lord silences all foolish talk about the superiority of Bhakti to Jnana. “My Bhakti is superior to your jnana – or my Jnana is superior to your Bhakti.” – Such half-digested nonsense should be given up once and for all.The Bhakta turns automatically into a Jnani and the Jnani takes to Bhakti when the mind is externalised. Who can be a greater Jnani than Adi Sankaracharya, and at the same time who can be a greater devotee? Do not his devotional songs, hundreds and thousands, breathe the very fragrance of Bhakti of the highest type? Taking any devotional song of his, one feels the thrill of Bhakti, of self-surrender, of ecstatic devotion, of perfect self-sacrifice. And on the other hand, his Vedantic proclamations ‘I am Siva and not – jiva’ show perfect oneness! There is no difference of God and devotee; it is all one undifferentiated ocean of Sachitananda. There ‘dasoham’ dissolves in ‘soham.’",
      "The point to note is that Self-realisation is the free gift of God, when he is pleased with the love of the devotee. He knows the opportune moment when this Atma jnana can flash in the mind of the devotee. Till the field is ready, no intelligent farmer sows the seeds. The Lord who is Omniscient can see the ripeness of His devotee’s heart, and that very moment Self-realisation dawns on the human heart. The Lord says, ‘dadami‘ (I will give) making it perfectly clear that the devotee has to keep his heart pure and ready to receive the yoga of Knowledge. The price of knowledge is devotion to the Lord. All the aspirants have to pass through these stages of development till perfection is attained. And perfection is the reward of God to His humble devotees.",
      "“The extremely beloved is desired; by whomsoever this Atman is extremely beloved, he becomes the most beloved of the Atman. So that this beloved may attain the Atman, the Lord Himself helps. For it has been said by the Lord: ‘Those who are constantly attached to Me and worship Me with love — I give that direction to their will by which they come to Me.’ Therefore it is said that, to whomsoever this remembering, which is of the same form as direct perception, is very dear, because it is dear to the Object of such memory perception, he is desired by the Supreme Atman, by him the Supreme Atman is attained. This constant remembrance is denoted by the word Bhakti.” So says Bhagavan Ramanuja in his commentary on the sutra “athato brahma-jijnasa”.[Source]",
      "One day he was illustrating his teachings with some very apt tales. I was surprised by the spontaneity with which these stories cropped up in his discussion, and I asked, “Sir, do you prepare your similes before you go out?”",
      "He said: “No. Mother is always present. Wherever I am, Mother supplies me with ideas.”",
      "‘No matter about philosophy, or even the Gita. The thing to do is to Know Mother. That is the whole of religion. Nothing else counts.’ Then again, ‘Take all your troubles to Mother. She will right all wrongs.’",
      "‘How will She right wrongs, Swami?’ asked someone.",

      "The Lord’s compassion for His devotees is revealed here. The Lord is pleased with their undivided devotion, and wishes to confer an eternal gift on them. The Lord knows wealth, power, position and children, are not eternal reward. They pass away in time. So He wishes to bestow on them the everlasting gift of Brahmajnana. We understand from this that no one can reach that state without God’s grace, and that God’s grace is to be attained by pure and perfect devotion to the Lord.",
      "Knowledge derived throughBuddhiyogais compared to a lamp that dispels darkness as soon as it is lighted. The light of knowledge thus shatters all darkness of ignorance. Nothing else but light can dispel darkness. One may struggle with darkness eternally with all his weapons, and yet it will not go, till by striking a match he brings in light. Such also is ignorance. One may do everything – Japa, Tapa, Pranayama, or Karma – and yet ignorance cannot be removed except by the flash of intuitional knowledge of Self. All other practices are intended to purify the mind and render it capable of perceiving the Truth (Brahman). They are means of Self-purification.",
      "Who causes this flash of knowledge? Who confers this Buddhiyoga? The Lord. Where is He seated? He is seated in the human heart. It is He who kindles the light of knowledge. Without His grace, this cannot happen. And this lamp of knowledge (jnanadipa) is luminous (bhasvata). It is self-luminous, it is luminosity itself. Its effect is immediate. The darkness of ignorance which is enveloping man for ages and ages is shattered at one stroke, once and for all. No more does he wander in the wilderness of samsara. No more does he think of quenching his thirst in the waters of a mirage. He now knows the sharp distinction between the real and the unreal. He is now aJivanmuktah. The bound soul who was thinking of himself as a body, subject to birth and death and all the thousand shocks of earthly existence, now realises in a flash that He is the immaculate and perfect Atma. He will realise that all those former thoughts of himself as a mortal, man and woman, weak and strong, happy and unhappy, lucky and unlucky, were mere superstitious hallucinations, and delusions. He will realise that at no time was he bound, that he is free at all times, but imagined himself to be bound and enslaved by ignorance (Avidya). He regains his freedom which is his birth-right, which he thought he had lost but which he never really lost. This knowledge comes to the devotee by the grace of the Lord.",
      "“I destroy the darkness born of ignorance is the exhortation of the Lord.” The Lord has declared that Maya is difficult to cross, but those who take refuge in Him cross over His Maya which is Divine and composed of qualities. As this is the Lord’s promise, the aspirants have the duty to put faith in Him and worship Him with all their heart and soul. Then they will receive Brahmajnana, as the highest reward of their devotion. It comes at the proper time when the aspirant is ripe enough to receive it. So, no one need be disheartened that he has not yet received the light. Let him carry out the command of the Lord and wait with absolute trust and faith in the Divine will.",

      "(To M.) “When God assumes a human body for the sake of His devotees, many of His devotees accompany Him to this earth. Some of them belong to the inner circle, some to the outer circle, and some become the suppliers of His physical needs.“I experienced one of my first ecstasies when I was ten or eleven years old, as I was going through a meadow to the shrine of Visalakshi. What a vision! I became completely unconscious of the outer world.“I was twenty-two or twenty-three when the Divine Mother one day asked me in the Kali temple, ‘Do you want to beAkshara?’ I didn’t know what the word meant. I asked Haladhari about it. He said, ‘Ksharameans jiva, living being;AksharameansParamatman, the Supreme Soul.’“At the hour of the evening worship in the Kali temple I would climb to the roof of the kuthi and cry out: ‘O devotees, where are you all? Come to me soon! I shall die of the company of worldly people!’ I told all this to the ‘Englishmen’. They said it was all an illusion of my mind. ‘Perhaps it is’, I said to myself, and became calm. But now it is all coming true; the devotees are coming.“The Divine Mother also showed me in a vision the five suppliers of my needs; first, Mathur Babu, and second, Sambhu Mallick, whom I had not then met. I had a vision of a fair-skinned man with a cap on his head. Many days later, when I first met Sambhu, I recalled that vision; I realised that it was he whom I had seen in that ecstatic state. I haven’t yet found out the three other suppliers of my wants. But they were all of a fair complexion. Surendra looks like one of them.“When I attained this state of God-Consciousness, a person exactly resembling myself thoroughly shook my Ida, Pingala, and Sushumna nerves. He licked with his tongue each of the lotuses of the six centres, and those drooping lotuses at once turned their faces upward. And at last the Sahasrara lotus became full-blown.“The Divine Mother used to reveal to me the nature of the devotees before their coming. I saw with these two eyes — not in a trance — the kirtan party of Chaitanya going from the banyan-tree to the bakul-tree in the Panchavati. I saw Balaram in the procession and also, I think, yourself [meaning M.]. Chuni’s spiritual consciousness and yours, too, have been awakened by frequent visits to me. In a vision I saw that Sashi and Sarat had been among the followers of Christ.“Under the banyan-tree in the Panchavati I had a vision of a child. Hriday said to me, ‘Then a son will soon be born to you.’ I said to him: ‘But I regard all women as mother. How can I have a son?’ That child is Rakhal.“I said to the Divine Mother, ‘O Mother, since You have placed me in this condition, provide me with a rich man.’ That is why Mathur served me for fourteen years.(From 1858 to 1871.) And in how many different ways! At my request he arranged a special store-room for the sadhus. He provided me with carriage and palanquin. And whatever I asked him to give to anyone, he gave. The Brahmani2identified him with Prataprudra.3“Vijay had a vision of this form [meaning himself]. How do you account for it? Vijay said to me, ‘I touched it exactly as I am touching you now.’“Latu counted thirty-one devotees in all. That’s not many. But a few more are becoming devotees through Vijay and Kedar.“It was revealed to me in a vision that during my last days I should have to live on pudding. During my present illness my wife was one day feeding me with pudding. I burst into tears and said, ‘Is this my living on pudding near the end, and so painfully?'” (Source:Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna)",
      "In 1910 Surendranath Sarkar went to Kothar, in Orissa, to receive initiation from Holy Mother. After the ceremony, he said to her: “Mother, the devotees call you Kali, Adyashakti, and Bhagavati. It is mentioned in the Gita that the sages Asita, Devala, Vyasa, and others considered Krishna to be Narayana Himself. Krishna himself confirmed this to Arjuna. The word ‘himself’ strengthened the statement. I believe whatever I have heard about you. Yet, if you substantiate those statements about yourself, then I will be free from doubt.

You may discriminate, saying that the ego is nothing at all; but still it comes, nobody knows from where. A goat’s legs jerk for a few moments even after its head has been cut off. Or perhaps you are frightened in a dream; you shake off sleep and are wide awake, but still you feel your heart palpitating. Egotism is exactly like that. You may drive it away, but still it appears from somewhere. Then you look sullen and say: ‘What! I have not been shown proper respect!'”KEDAR:“‘One should be lowlier than a straw and patient as a tree.'”MASTER:“As for me, I consider myself as a speck of the dust of the devotee’s feet.”Vaidyanath arrived.

I said to him; ‘If there are no greater and lesser manifestations of His Power, then why have we taken the trouble to visit you? Have you grown two horns?’ So it stands to reason that God exists in all beings as the All-pervasive Power; but the manifestations of His Power are different in different beings.”(Source:Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna)"

The Jiva, by ignorance, has identified himself with the extraneous body and mind, and thus he has forgotten his divine nature. When knowledge dawns, this very Jiva comes to realise in a flash that he is Paramatma Himself, and there the quest for Truth comes to an end, for he has now discovered that he is the all-pervading all-blissful, omniscient Self of all. All ideas of littleness and separateness are mere superstitions and hallucinations.

And yet all the power of Hiranyakasipu was of no avail when he had to deal with his own little child Prahlada, who was born with Brahmajnana by the grace of Narada. The Daitya King tried all weapons at his command to kill Prahlada, but nothing could destroy the child who was one with the Lord Himself. So the Lord here declares that He is Prahlada among the Daityas. In the supreme state of Bhakti, the devotee and the Lord are one. Though the child was born in the demonical race, yet he could attain Divinity and perfection. So, race and birth are of no importance in spiritual enlightenment. Everyone can seek for it and find it by the very purity of his heart and the intensity of his devotion.",

Don’t you see that among human beings there are cheats and gamblers, to say nothing of men who are like tigers. I think of them as the ‘cheat God’, the ‘tiger God’.” …….",

But to cook rice on that fire, eat the rice, and get nourishment from it is vijnana. To know by one’s inner experience that God exists is jnana. But to talk to Him, to enjoy Him as Child, as Friend, as Master, as Beloved, is vijnana. The realisation that God alone has become the universe and all living beings is vijnana.",

Let no man imagine that he has anything to be proud of. If he has prosperity, that prosperity is the Lord’s; if he has power and intelligence, all that is the Lord’s; if he has genius that genius is the Lord’s. He who thinks that they are his own possessions is guilty of misappropriating the Lord’s plenty, and should suffer the penalty of loss and bereavement. These great attributes of the Lord should be contemplated continuously, so that they may become part and parcel of one’s own nature and lead him to union with the Lord.",

The Lord has declared to the Hindu in His incarnation as Krishna, “I am in every religion as the thread through a string of pearls. Wherever thou seest extraordinary holiness and extraordinary power raising and purifying humanity, know thou that I am there.” And what has been the result? I challenge the world to find, throughout the whole system of Sanskrit philosophy, any such expression as that the Hindu alone will be saved and not others.[Source]",

Nay, the greatest of these Incarnations goes further: “Wherever an extraordinary spiritual power is manifested by external man, know that I am there; it is from Me that that manifestation comes.” That leaves the door open for the Hindu to worship the Incarnations of all the countries in the world. The Hindu can worship any sage and any saint from any country whatsoever, and as a fact we know that we go and worship many times in the churches of the Christians, and many, many times in the Mohammedan mosques, and that is good. Why not? Ours, as I have said, is the universal religion. It is inclusive enough, it is broad enough to include all the ideals. All the ideals of religion that already exist in the world can be immediately included, and we can patiently wait for all the ideals that are to come in the future to be taken in the same fashion, embraced in the infinite arms of the religion of the Vedanta.[Source]",

If there is no special manifestation of power, then why is Queen Victoria so much honoured and respected? Don’t you admit it?’ He agreed with me.”The pundit and his friends saluted the Master and were about to take their leave. Sri Ramakrishna said to the pundit: “Come again.

Pointing to his stomach, Michael said, ‘It was for this.’ Narayan said,‘What shall I say to a man who gives up his religion for his belly’s sake?’Thereupon Michael asked me to say something.
