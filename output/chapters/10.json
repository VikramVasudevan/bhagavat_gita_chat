    "transliteration": "śhrī bhagavān uvāchabhūya eva mahā-bāho śhṛiṇu me paramaṁ vachaḥyatte ’haṁ prīyamāṇāya vakṣhyāmi hita-kāmyayā",
    "word_by_word_meaning": "śhrī-bhagavān uvācha—the Lord said; bhūyaḥ—again; eva—verily; mahā-bāho—mighty armed one; śhṛiṇu—hear; me—my; paramam—divine; vachaḥ—teachings; yat—which; te—to you; aham—I; prīyamāṇāya—you are my beloved confidant; vakṣhyāmi—say; hita-kāmyayā—desiring your welfare",
    "translation": "The Lord said: Once more, Ο mighty Arjuna, listen to My supreme word, which I, from a desire for your welfare, will impart to you, to your great delight.",
    "commentary": "The Lord was pleased to find that Arjuna, like a true disciple, was diligently listening to His words, most delighted with the teaching of the Divine Master. So the Lord proceeds to declare more and more of his divine power even before he asks for it. Such would be the love of the Master of a true disciple. As the Master finds the disciple in a receptive mood, full of faith and diligence, he reveals more of the Royal Secret out of the fulness of His heart. That is why the Lord says “delighting in my words” (“Priyamanaya’), referring to Arjuna’s absorption in His teaching. Arjuna’s doubt and grief were disappearing fast as the Lord continued to speak. The Lord knew it. So he speaks with a mightier accent and reveals more of His Divine Yoga. Again (Bhuyah) the Lord repeats and emphasises His universality and the hearer understands it, thinks of it and meditates on it. Repeated hearing of the Truth, constant thinking of it, and continuous meditation on it – this is the only way to absorb the Truth and make it one’s own.Vivekananda says: “This Atman is first to be heard of. Hear day and night that you are that Soul. Repeat it to yourself day and night till it enters into your very veins, till it tingles in every drop of blood, till it is in your flesh and bone.” Such should be the immovable firmness of conviction in the Divine Truth. So the Lord repeats, expounds, declares, and proclaims His Divine Glory.",

    "commentary": "The Lord is the Ancient Purusha, the ultimate cause and source of all the worlds and beings. From Him proceed all the Devas and Maharshis. Even they are not able to understand the infinite mystery of the Lord. Endowed with wisdom, if these great souls fail to know the Lord fully, what to speak of other mortals? No one can measure the infinitude of the Lord with his finite mind. So, what man can aspire for, is simply to surrender to Him, and obtain His grace, by which he merges in and becomes one with him.",

    "translation": "Who knows Me as the birthless, without a beginning, the Lord of all the worlds, he among mortals is undeluded and freed from all sins.",
    "commentary": "Among living beings of the world, man is the highest incarnation and among mortals, he who knows the Lord as unborn and beginningless is the greatest. Paramatma is unborn (ajah) and He has no beginning (anadi). All other beings have a beginning and end. They are born in time and die in time. Knowledge of Paramatma alone confers immortality on man. He becomes free from delusion. This indeed is the highest reward which man can get by his devotion to the Lord. All other worldly benefits are impermanent and illusory. They lead to sorrow and death. So it is the primary duty of all seekers to hold on to the Lord and transcend delusion with His grace. When delusion is gone, man is at once freed from all sin. When man becomes sinless he becomes one with Paramatma. Though a man is burdened with all the sins in the world, yet, like fire burning up a vast forest, God’s grace destroys the entire sin. So, devotion to the Lord is what is most essential. And his devotion is cultivated, strengthened, and developed by understanding the infinite Glory of the Lord. As man thinks constantly of the inscrutable power of the Lord, his adoration increases, and his worship becomes truer, deeper, and broader.",

    "commentary": "Sixteen good qualities and four bad qualities are mentioned in these two verses. All these qualities proceed from the Lord Himself. What does this mean? It does not mean that God gives good qualities to some people and bad qualities to others. He has already declared “There is no one hateful or dear to Me.” This being so, the qualities exhibited by different people are the result of their own thoughts and actions. Men who contemplate the righteous become good, possessing all divine qualities, and others who think and act in the opposite direction becomes bad, possessing undivine qualities. It is by the Lord’s power that these qualities, good and bad come to man, though the Lord is just a witness only and is not affected by them. The Lord does not cause karma. He is not the doer of karma, (‘karmakarta‘). He is the dispenser of the fruits of the action (‘karmaphalapradata‘). It is in this sense that we have to understand the Lord’s declaration.",

The Lord is the only Reality. All the worlds and beings have come forth from Him. To realise this Truth is to know Him in essence. The faith of such a devotee is unshaken, and so he is fully absorbed in the contemplation of the Lord. His faith is immovable because he has traced the origin of everything to the Lord. So whatever he sees, he discovers it as the Lord. Both internally and externally he sees the Lord and nothing else. The Lord assures that he is united with Him undoubtedly.",

    "commentary": "There are many who repeat God’s name, serve Him, and meditate on Him. But very few are capable of pure devotion born of true realisation that He is the source of all things. Pure devotion is therefore the result of real understanding of the creative power of the Lord and His wonderful manifestation.Without understanding how the Lord is present in the universe, it is difficult to cultivate true faith, and without faith pure devotion is not possible.When man knows that the Lord is the final cause of everything, and that there is nothing else but He in all things, he spontaneously offers worship to Him. Such an act of devotion and surrender will be deep-felt, sincere and true. The devotee’s surrender is deep, firm, unalterable and unconditional, for the very reason that he knows the real presence of the Lord in everything and all that takes place in the universe.",

    "commentary": "The life of the true devotee is beautifully described in this verse. The life and mental functions of the ignorant are wholly devoted to the world, and they live and die entangled in the meshes of samsara. But the real devotee consecrates his body, mind and life to the Lord. His mind thinks of the Lord; his limbs do the work of the Lord; his eyes see the Lord; his reason understands the presence of the Lord everywhere. His whole life is thus absorbed in the Lord. His whole life is a continued worship. When the devotees meet together they only talk of God, His power, and Yoga. God’s glory is infinite. Everywhere, in everything, God’s power is manifesting itself. So the devotee goes on thinking and speaking of God’s Glory. Such holy company is the highest spiritual education that man can get. All doubts are cleared by mutual enlightenment. There is a powerful current, spiritual thought, and emotion, circulating among them. The very air they breathe is full of knowledge and bliss.",

All seekers are functioning through the senses and the mind, and the objective world is present before their eyes. The Lord having permeated the whole universe, in what and what aspects and forms He should be cognised and worshipped is the question. The Lord points out some of the outstanding manifestations of His Divine Glory.The Seeker may take up any form and offer worship in the firm belief that it is the Supreme Lord Himself.",
