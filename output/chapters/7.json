    "commentary": [
      "Few people are eager to know the Lord, and among those who are eager to know, only a few are able to know Him in essence. Indeed, very rare are those who could know him fully and without any doubt. Three conditions are prescribed.",
      "The mind is like a powerful search-light. When it is turned aside, the objective world is seen; When it is turned inwards, the Self is seen. The mind thinks only of that to which it is attached. As the ignorant man is attached to the material world, his mind rambles continuously sense objects and is satisfied with sense-pleasures. Such a man cannot know the Lord- Paramatma. The wise man, turning away from the objective world, thinks of the Reality understands the Truth, and enjoys peace and bliss. Therefore the Lord speaks of the yogi as one who is attached to the Lord and for whom the Lord is the sole refuge.",
      "The yoga of Devotion and Dhyana are both aids to know the Lord and become one with Him.",
      "Moreover, in this verse, the doubt is cleared on how the Lord is to be known. He could be known by devotion to Him, by seeking refuge in Him, and by meditation on Him.",
      "Sri Ramakrishna Says —",
      "Men shed streams of tears because sons are not born to them, others wear away their hearts in sorrow because they cannot get riches. But alas ! How many are there who sorrow and weep for not having seen God ? very few indeed ! Verily, he who seeks Him, who weeps for Him, attains Him.",
      "A Disciple asked his teacher, “Sir, please tell me how I can see God.” “Come with me,” said the Guru, “and I shall show you.” He took the disciple to a lake, and both of them got into the water. Suddenly the teacher pressed the disciple’s head under the water. After a few moments he released him and the disciple raised his head and stood up. The Guru asked him, “How did you feel?” The disciple said, “Oh! I thought I should die; I was panting for breath.” The teacher said, “When you feel like that for God, then you will know you haven’t long to wait for His vision.”",
      "Two words in this verse are significant—asaṃśayamandsamagram. asaṃśayam means free of doubt. We can be perfectly doubtless only about one thing, and that is our own existence. When the knowledge is about the Self, no doubt is possible. It is One, non-dual and pure Consciousness. When one listens to the teaching from a perfect, authentic Master and absorbs it, the knowledge that is assimilated within will be such that no tinge of doubt will remain in him. And the knowledge will be samagram—complete, perfect. Completion or perfection is only in Consciousness, in the Chit, in the Self. Hence, only Self-knowledge can give us perfection. Any knowledge related to the world can never be perfect because it is ever-expanding in time, space and causation. It will never reach an end. Just as knowledge about objects and persons seen in a dream is illusory and can never be perfect, similarly, any knowledge about the world has no absolute reality.",
      "It is fascinating to note that in the first verse of this chapter, Bhagavan has used the word samagram, which means complete, perfect. Towards the end, inverse 29, Bhagavan uses the word kṛtsnam, full. Both mean the same. There Bhagavan says that such a person realises Brahman, adhyātma and karma. This means that the secret behind everything—God, the mind and the world—is revealed to him.",

    "commentary": [
      "Sri Krishna ended thesixth chapterby describing the supreme yogi as one who, with his inmost self abiding in Him, adores the Lord. Arjuna will now be taught the nature of the Lord Himself, who is the object of the yogi’s unwavering devotion.",
      "The Lord’s love for the devotee is infinite. He wants to reveal everything to his disciple, make him understand the Supreme so that his mind shall not wander in ignorance at any time thereafter in the world. Lord Krishna teaches Arjuna the highest wisdom associated with personal and direct experience.",
      "There are several arts and sciences in the world. Though a man may know many or most of them, his knowledge is not complete. Something still remains to be known. Butif the Lord is known, not merely by speculation or argument, but by direct experience, then man feels that there is nothing else to be known in the world.",
      "The Lord’s statement here agrees with the Upanishadic declaration. So the aim of the aspirant is not to know this or that or a hundred things, but to know that, knowing which the essence of all is fully realised. All search for knowledge ends here. There is nothing else to be known.When the base of the plant is watered, it is the same as watering the branches, blossoms, and fruits of the plant. We do not pour water on every leaf and flower. Even so, when the supreme Brahman is realised, all the experiences in the world are comprehended by that knowledge.When Lord Siva asked his sons Vighneswara and Kumaraswamy to go and make a circuit of the world, Kumaraswamy took the pain of flying all the way round the world, whereas Vighneswara went round Lord Siva and received the reward of circuiting the whole world as Lord Siva himself is the whole world. Even so, Brahmajnana comprehends the knowledge of everything else. Man’s lifetime is short and many are the sciences and arts, and no one can hope to know them all. The best way to know them all is to know the Divine essence immanent in all of them. What is the basic truth behind the whole of the phenomenal world? That question can be answered only by self-realisation, and not by the study of any number of sciences for any length of time. Out of compassion for his friend and disciple, Lord Krishna offers him that supreme knowledge.",
      "Here two words are used Jnana and Vijnana-Jnana means knowledge derived from the study of sastras. It is ‘Sabdabrahma’. Vijnana means realisation of Atma i.e. parabrahma’. Supreme peace and bliss is the reward of realisation, and not of indirect knowledge born of Sastraic learning. The Lord declares that he will teach the truth, fully and completely. Verily nothing is left out. Another interpretation of the words Jnana and Vijnana may also be given. Jnana may be understood as the quality of the Jnana, like humility etc., mentioned in the13th Discourse. Vijnana may be taken to mean Knowledge of the Supreme Brahman.",
      "Sri Ramakrishna gives a lucid description of jñāna and vijñāna(The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna, 1942, New York edition, pp. 105–06):",
      "‘The jñāni gives up his identification with worldly things, discriminating, “not this, not this” (neti, neti). Only then can he realize Brahman. It is like reaching the roof of a house by leaving the steps behind, one by one.",
      "‘But the vijñāni, who is more intimately acquainted with Brahman, realizes something more. He realizes that the steps are made of the same materials as the roof: bricks, lime, and brick dust. That which is realized intuitively as Brahman, through the eliminating process of “not this, not this”, is then found to have become the universe and all its living beings. The vijñāni sees that the Reality which is nirguṇa, without attributes, is also saguṇa, with attributes.",
      "‘A man cannot live on the roof for a long time. He comes down again. Those who realize Brahman in samādhi come down also and find that it is Brahman that has become the universe and its living beings. In the musical scale there are the notes, sā, re, ga, ma, pa, dha, and ni; but one cannot keep one’s voice on “ni” a long time. The ego does not vanish all together. The man coming down from samādhi perceives that it is Brahman that has become the ego, the universe, and all living beings. That is known as vijñāna. ’",
      "It is true that the Upanishads have this one theme before them:कस्मिन्नु भगवो विज्ञाते सर्वमिदं विज्ञातं भवति।— “What is that knowing which we know everything else?” In modern language, the theme of the Upanishads is to find an ultimate unity of things. Knowledge is nothing but finding unity in the midst of diversity. Every science is based upon this; all human knowledge is based upon the finding of unity in the midst of diversity; and if it is the task of small fragments of human knowledge, which we call our sciences, to find unity in the midst of a few different phenomena, the task becomes stupendous when the theme before us is to find unity in the midst of this marvellously diversified universe, where prevail unnumbered differences in name and form, in matter and spirit — each thought differing from every other thought, each form differing from every other form. Yet, to harmonise these many planes and unending Lokas, in the midst of this infinite variety to find unity, is the theme of the Upanishads. On the other hand, the old idea of Arundhati Nyâya applies. To show a man the fine star Arundhati, one takes the big and brilliant nearest to it, upon which he is asked to fix his eyes first, and then it becomes quite easy to direct his sight to Arundhati. This is the task before us, and to prove my idea I have simply to show you the Upanishads, and you will see it. Nearly every chapter begins with dualistic teaching, Upâsanâ. God is first taught as some one who is the Creator of this universe, its Preserver, and unto whom everything goes at last. He is one to be worshipped, the Ruler, the Guide of nature, external and internal, yet appearing as if He were outside of nature and external. One step further, and we find the same teacher teaching that this God is not outside of nature, but immanent in nature. And at last both ideas are discarded, and whatever is real is He; there is no difference. तत्त्वमसि श्वेतकेतो — “Shvetaketu, That thou art.” That Immanent One is at last declared to be the same that is in the human soul. Here is no Compromise; here is no fear of others’ opinions. Truth, bold truth, has been taught in bold language, and we need not fear to preach the truth in the same bold language today, and, by the grace of God, I hope at least to be one who dares to be that bold preacher.[Source]",
      "The Master (Sri Ramakrishna) told me many times: “What is there in the scriptures? They are like sheets of paper with a shopping list on them. The list is useful only for checking off the items once purchased. When you have done that, the list is thrown away. So you should check your knowledge, your devotion, and consult the scriptures to see whether they agree. It is said, ‘When you have the knowledge of the Absolute, the scriptures are worth only a straw.’” The Divine Mother had shown Sri Ramakrishna what was in the scriptures, the Puranas, and the Tantric literature. So, though he was an unlettered person, he was able to lower the pride of the pandits. He used to say,“If you get a tiny ray of light from the Divine Mother, it makes all learning pale into insignificance.”",
      "Sri Ramakrishna sounded like a drunkard when he talked to the Divine Mother, saying:“Do not give me the knowledge of Brahman, Mother! I don’t want it! I spit on it!”I was an extreme Vedantist at that time, and his words shocked me very much. I thought to myself: “My goodness! What can be greater than the knowledge of Brahman?”— Swami Turiyananda (Source: Ramakrishna as We Saw Him)",
      "Swami Bhaskareswarananda Maharaj told me about his meeting Holy Mother Sri Sarada Devi as a young college student. He was then known as Vipradas. “I had read the life of Sri Ramakrishna and was studying Eastern and Western philosophy in college. My mother Smt. Shantasheela Devi was a disciple of Holy Mother. Once I asked her, ‘You say that the Holy Mother and Sri Ramakrishna are one. I cannot understand it.’ When my mother tried to explain I began to argue with her. Finally, she said, ‘My son, I cannot convince you. You yourself ask this question to Holy Mother. She is staying at the Baghbazar house.’ I had not seen Holy Mother. So one day she took me with her to Baghbazar, Udbodhan house. Swami Saradanandaji was studying in the side room to the left of the entrance. He knew my mother, and so as soon as he saw her, he asked, ‘You are coming after a long time. And who is this boy?’ My mother replied, ‘Maharaj, he is my youngest son. He is very argumentative. He asks how Sri Thakur and Holy Mother are one and the same.’ So I have brought him here, so that he can ask Holy Mother herself.’ On hearing this, Saradanandaji told me to go upstairs and ask Mother.",
      "“I went upstairs, but could not find Holy Mother. I came down and informed Maharaj that there was nobody there except a chair covered with a white cloth. Then Maharaj answered, ‘Oh! That is Holy Mother sitting covered with a white sari!’ So, I, again went upstairs and approaching the chair saw two toes of Holy Mother’s holy feet slightly uncovered. When I offered my pranams, she asked, ‘Who are you?’ I replied that I was Shantasheela’s son. At this Holy Mother lifted her big veil and I saw her divine face! First she fed me with some refreshment, and understanding that I had come with some doubt, asked me what I wanted to ask. Promptly I asked her,‘Holy Mother, my mother says that you and Sri Thakur are one. Thakur passed way in 1886 and you are seen by us — giving advice and solving devotees’ difficulties. Then how is it that you and Thakur are one?’Holy Mother did not speak a word. Silently she pointed to the picture of Sri Ramakrishna in her shrine and then pointing to herself she raised her index finger indicated their oneness. That was enough to give me the conviction that Sri Ramakrishna and she are not separate, but are the all-pervading transcendental divinity appearing as two. When my mother came upstairs and offered her pranams, Holy Mother told her,‘Shanti, you have three sons, you give me this boy.’Immediately, my mother joyfully replied ‘I give this son to you.’",
      "“After this, my mother began to prepare me to become a sannyasi of Ramakrishna Order. By Holy Mother’s grace I joined Belur Math as a brahmachari in 1922, and received mantradiksha from Swami Shivanandaji.” (Similar Incident:All three are one)",
      "— Swami Brahmasthananda, Adhyaksha, Nagpur Ashrama",
      "A man prays to God for what he loves most. A lover of wealth prays for money; a lover of name and fame prays for recognition; a lover of pleasure prays for enjoyment; a lover of aesthetics prays for beauty; a lover of the body prays for good health; a lover of knowledge prays for intellectual pursuits. Most people love God’s powers, but few love God. We do not realize that if we seek God, we will attain God as well as the wisdom and strength to handle worldly success. If, however, we seek only success and power, we may get them, but eventually they become sources of bondage.",
      "Once Sri Ramakrishna asked Manindra Krishna Gupta: “What do you want?” “I want to express my ideas about the beauty of the world and human nature — that is my desire,” replied the young Manindra. “That is fine,” said Sri Ramakrishna with a smile.“But if you realize God, you will achieve everything.”(Source: They Lived with God)",

      "As Sri Ramakrishna sang the last song he went into samadhi. The devotees sat speechless, gazing at his radiant figure. After some time he regained partial consciousness of the world and began to talk to the Divine Mother.The Master said, “Mother, please come down from up there.” Did he feel his mind still lingering in the seventh plane of consciousness, the thousand-petalled lotus of the Sahasrara?“Please do come down”, he said. “Don’t torment me that way. Be still, Mother, and sit down.“O Mother, everybody’s future is determined by the tendencies of his previous births. What shall I say to these people? Nothing can be achieved without discrimination and renunciation.”",
      "Sri Ramakrishna had now regained full consciousness of the world, and he continued: “There are many kinds of renunciation. One of them may be called ‘markatavairagya’, ‘monkey renunciation’. It is a false renunciation stimulated by the afflictions of the world. That renunciation doesn’t last long. Then there is real renunciation. A man with everything in the world, lacking nothing, feels all to be unreal.“It is not possible to acquire renunciation all at once. The time factor must be taken into account. But it is also true that a man should hear about it. When the right time comes, he will say to himself, ‘Oh yes, I heard about this.’“You must also remember another thing. By constantly hearing about renunciation one’s desire for worldly objects gradually wears away. One should take rice-water in small doses to get rid of the intoxication of liquor. Then one gradually becomes normal.“An aspirant entitled to the Knowledge of God is very rare. It is said in theGitathat one in thousands desires to know God, and again that among thousands who have such a desire, only one is able to know God.”(BG 7.3)A devotee quoted the text from the Gita.MASTER:“As your attachment to the world diminishes your spiritual knowledge will increase. Attachment to the world means attachment to ‘woman and gold’.",
      "“It is not given to everybody to feel prema, ecstatic love of God. Chaitanya experienced it. An ordinary man can at the most experience bhava. Only the Isvarakotis, such as Divine Incarnations, experience prema. When prema is awakened the devotee not only feels the world to be unreal forgets even the body, which everyone loves so intensely.“In a Persian book it is said that inside the skin is the flesh, inside the flesh the bone, inside the bone, the marrow and so on but that prema is the innermost of all. One becomes soft and tender through prema. On account of this prema, Krishna became Tribhanga.1“Prema is the rope by which you can tether God, as it were. Whenever you want to see Him you have merely to pull the rope. Whenever you call Him, He will appear before you.“The mature stage of bhakti is bhava. When one attains it one remains speechless, thinking of Satchidananda. The feeling of an ordinary man can go only that far. When bhava ripens it becomes mahabhava. Prema is the last. You know the difference between a green mango and a ripe one. Unalloyed love of God is the essential thing. All else is unreal. (Source:Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna)"

Purusha, Atma, or Brahman, is the life-principle. Prakriti is the objective universe (drisya) and Purusha is the seer (drik). Prakriti is liable to destruction, but Purusha is eternal. Mind, reason and egoism are also included in Prakrifi along with the grosser elements. The elements are insentient and so the modifications of internal nature are also insentient. When it is known that the mind is insentient, its power and virulence are lost. It is held and controlled like any other material object. The insentient can never have power over the sentient. Those who do not know this secret come under the power of the mind and dance to its tune. So to control the mind, one should clearly distinguish between the gross and the sentient, and between that which is Jada’ and that which is ‘Chit’.",

      "The Lord now explains the ‘Para Prakriti’ the Higher Nature. It is the life-element by which the whole universe is upheld. Even this, like the ‘apara prakriti‘ is under the control of the Lord, the Purusha. Let us understand the distinction between theparaandaparaPrakriti by means of an illustration.There is a pot filled with water, and the orb of the Sun is reflected in it. Here the pot and water are apara Prakriti- inferior nature, and the reflected orb of the sun shining in the water is para prakriti, Higher nature. The pot stands for the body, the water for the mind, and the reflected sun for the individual self (ego) by which man is deluded into thinking that he is a distinct and real personality. The real sun shining in the sky is Atma, Pursha, the Lord. When the pot and water are destroyed, the sun is not at all affected by it. He shines in his own pristine glory.So the falling away of the body does not make any difference to Atma which is Eternal. Sankaracharya in the Viveka Chudamani explains this idea very clearly.",
      "The wise man leaves the pot, water and the reflection, and looks at the real self-luminous Sun. So also the man of knowledge does not attach himself to the body, mind, and egoism, which appears as his individual self. He takes refuge in Atma which is distinct from all these three, in the same way as the Sun in the sky is absolutely separate from that which is reflected in the water.",
      "All the changes pertain to the pot water and the reflection in it. The real Sun does not change. The pot may be big or small, the water pure or muddy. This does not affect the sun. So also the changes that take place in the body and mind of man does not affect Atma. The para and apara prakriti of the Lord undergoe all sorts of modification, but the Lord, Purusha, is not touched by them at all. The elements (apara prakriti) are insentient. According to the Advaitic concept, both the Prakritis are unreal. What is real is Atma. The seeker has to give up both the lower and higher Prakriti in order to reach Atma. Of course, the life element, the personality state, is superior to the gross insentient matter. But it is also a component part of nature and cannot claim the attribute of Reality. The man in a dream may be superior to the rocks and trees of the dream, but to the awakened man both the dream-man and dream world are utterly unreal. Thus we arrive at the one supreme Reality in para and apara Prakriti dwell, subject to the control of the Purusha. Knowing that the individual ego and the world are both unreal, the seeker has to take refuge in the Supreme Brahman.",
      "Question:What is Para Prakriti?",
      "Answer:It is the life-element. By it, the universe is sustained. It is superior to the apara prakriti.",

      "Prakriti in its two aspects, para and apara, is the womb of all beings. Purusha is the Master and cause of all creation, sustenance, and destruction of the entire universe. Prakriti is the instrument with which he creates, maintains, and destroys the whole universe. Therefore tracing back to the root cause of all things, we find that the whole manifested universe and the unmanifested will be found to come out of Brahman and got dissolved in Brahman. The Omnipotent, Omniscient Brahman is the material and efficient cause of the universe. According to the Advaitic concept, the Supreme Self is just the witness of all creation and destruction and is not affected by them.",

      "The string holds the clusters of gems together, without which they fall off like disintegrated elements. Moreover, though the gems are of different shapes, sizes and colours, the string that holds them together is the same. Thus, different beings, races, classes, types of beings, different religions and creeds, and all things sentient and insentient are held together by the indwelling presence of the Lord. The naked eye could see only the gems and not the string behind. and So also, the eye of the common man can see only the outer form of the universe and not the unifying existence of the Lord behind.",
      "Any rational human being can understand the presence of the string behind the gems, though he does not see it with his naked eye. To deny the existence of the string on the ground that he cannot see is sheer ignorance. Such talk of the unwise carries no conviction, even as the denial of the existence of the sun by a blind man. It is not the naked eye but the eye of knowledge that can perceive the Lord as the eternal substratum and sustaining power behind the universe.",
      "He who sees the sentient in the midst of the insentient, the eternal in the midst of the perishable, the changeless in the midst of the changing, is the wise man. It is the eye of Knowledge. The Upadhi (i.e.) the body – vehicle is insentient. But pervading the whole universe, there is the Omniscient Lord and He could be perceived only by the eye of Knowledge. The naked eye is made to see the outer form, and recognises it by its ‘nama‘ and ‘rupa‘. But when the eye of knowledge is opened by the grace of the Lord, His presence is recognised everywhere. Then will man understand that He is the final cause of the universe, that He is in everything, creating, sustaining, and destroying everything by the power of His Prakriti. He who sees the body is the ignorant man, he who sees the jiva is the partially wise; but he who sees Atma is the sage.",

      "It is the same light coming through glasses of different colours. And these little variations are necessary for purposes of adaptation. But in the heart of everything the same truth reigns. The Lord has declared to the Hindu in His incarnation as Krishna, “I am in every religion as the thread through a string of pearls.”[Source]",
      "So it is with this universal religion, which runs through all the various religions of the world in the form of God; it must and does exist through eternity. “I am the thread that runs through all these pearls,” and each pearl is a religion or even a sect thereof. Such are the different pearls, and the Lord is the thread that runs through all of them; only the majority of mankind are entirely unconscious of it.[Source]",
      "In the Gita we already hear the distant sound of the conflicts of sects, and the Lord comes in the middle to harmonize them all; He, the great preacher of harmony, the greatest teacher of harmony, Lord Shri Krishna. He says, “In Me they are all strung like pearls upon a thread.”[Source]",

      "The idea of the cruel and ruthless Jehovah in the Old Testament has frightened many — but why? What right have they to assume that the Jehovah of the ancient Jews must represent the conventional idea of the God of the present day? At the same time, we must not forget that there will come men after us who will laugh at our ideas of religion and God in the same way that we laugh at those of the ancients. Yet, through all these various conceptions runs the golden thread of unity, and it is the purpose of the Vedanta to discover this thread. “I am the thread that runs through all these various ideas, each one of which is like a pearl,” says the Lord Krishna; and it is the duty of Vedanta to establish this connecting thread, however incongruous or disgusting may seem these ideas when judged according to the conceptions of today. These ideas, in the setting of past times, were harmonious and not more hideous than our present ideas. It is only when we try to take them out of their settings and apply to our present circumstances that the hideousness becomes obvious. For the old surroundings are dead and gone. Just as the ancient Jew has developed into the keen, modern, sharp Jew, and the ancient Aryan into the intellectual Hindu, similarly Jehovah has grown, and Devas have grown.[Source]",

      "In the previousverse, it is declared that the Lord is present in the whole universe, like the string in the garland of gems. To show this truth, the Lord takes certain objects and explains how He is present in them. He is in the form of taste in water, light in the sun and the moon, Pranava (OM) in the Vedas, and virility in men. Thus His presence is to be realised in all things. Taste and water, light and the sun, are inseparable. There is light where there is sun. We cannot conceive the sun without his light. Since it is difficult to conceive the universal presence of the Lord in the beginning, He illustrates the idea with reference to certain objects.",
      "He is the syllable OM in all the Vedas. The essence of the Vedas is to be found in OM. No man can possibly study all the Vedas completely. Human life is too short for that purpose. So, if the syllable OM is understood and contemplated, man obtains the very essence of all the Vedas and fulfills his life. So repeating the syllable OM, contemplating the meaning of that sacred sound, thinking of the Lord as Pranava, man attains the highest.",
      "The Lord is virility in men. Virility, strength, courage, and determination are all divine qualities. Timidity, weakness, and dullness are all unmanly qualities. We see the Lord Himself when we come across bold and courageous men, who readily sacrifice their life for a righteous cause. We see the Lord in the great sages and Rishis, who have overcome insuperable obstacles with courage and determination. The supreme manifestation of the Lord is magnificently described in theNinth Discourse. The seeker should cultivate courage, enthusiasm, strength and resolution in his spiritual life.",

Then suddenly I made a very big opening.”",

      "Bijam– The Lord declares that He is the seed, the cause of all beings. From Him, the seed, all beings have come, and unto Him they return. The tree is only another form of the seed. The life-force of the whole tree is already involved in the seed. The seed manifests its life-force in the new form of the tree. Even so, the Lord is the seed of all beings. It is He who is manifesting Himeself in different forms. The essence is He in every thing. Thus knowing the wise man transcends all separateness that appears to exist between one thing and another. Whoever he may be, to whatever caste or creed he may belong, high or low, the seed for him is God Himself. He is the cause of He is the father of all. So all beings in essence are God, for there is nothing else but He in the whole universe. He is the cause, and He is also the effect, and the effect is actually the cause in a different form. Knowing this, let no man imagine himself to be weak, neglected, forlorn and wretched. He is God Himself. By ignorance, he has misunderstood himself to be a limited body and a limited personality. Inspired by the words of the Lord let man throw away the veil of ignorance, and know himself as he really is (i.e.) the Supreme Brahman.",
      "The inspiring message of Gitacharya is that He is Himself the seed and cause of all beings. He is present in all. This should give tremendous courage to all because it affirms the divine birth-right of each individual. Even the lowest would acquire Himalayan strength when he contemplates this truth. There is nothing low or wretched. The teacher of the Gita says, “I am the underlying principle behind you. It is from Me you have come.” Such words would lift up the sinking hearts of thousands of house-holders caught in the whirlpool of samsara. What if the wave is small or big? It has behind it the mighty ocean. It subsists and is sustained by the infinite ocean. So let no man consider himeself weak, mean and downtrodden. Let him contemplate the mighty ocean of purity and blessedness with which he is one, even as the ripple is one with the sea. The source of every man is not either his father or grandfather, but the supreme Paramatma.",

Whether it is intellectual or physical strength, if it is employed for selfish purposes to serve the lower impulses, it is wretched. In such cases, it is only demonical might, an asuric force, leading to self-destruction. The might of Ravana was impure by Kama, and it lead to his destruction and that of his people. So purity in strength, nobility in might, is what the Lord wants people to cultivate. His presence is felt in such strength.",
      "The Lord is also ‘desire’ (kama) unopposed to Dharma. The desire to maintain one’s family in a good condition, to live in society without becoming a burden on others, to relieve the suffering of others – such desire, though it is kama, is the divine aspect of the Lord. There is no evil in such desire.",
      "There are three distinct stages in the development of man. In the first stage, man’s desires instinctively run after sense-enjoyments and the gratification of lust and greed. In the second stage, desire becomes ennobled to the higher plane of selfless acts of service, generosity, and benevolence. It is then purified of its former evil. In the third and last stage, desires disappear from the mind when man realises the true Self. Then there are no desires, good or bad. It is true that Self realisation is not possible without giving up all desires. But man’s development is traceable from bad to good, and from good to the free state of Moksha. Here the Lord speaks of the second stage. Desires which agree with the Sastras, which do not run counter to Dharma, produce no evil effects. Gradually, man should rise to the ‘nirvikalpa‘ state of mind. Give up bad desires, and then give up all desires, and be thoroughly contented in the Self. This is the significance of the Lord’s statement here."

    "commentary": [
      "The Lord has already declared that He is the sustaining power behind the universe. What is sustained cannot be without the power that sustains it. So the existence of Paramatma makes the existence of everything possible. Minus Paramatma, nothing can exist. The universe as we see it with all its panoramic changes is the creative power of the Lord. In the same way as the snake in the rope is sustained by the rope itself, the Lord is the cause of the illusory universe, and just as the rope is really a rope even during the time of one’s illusion, so also the Lord is Himself of the universe whether one realises it or not. Just as the snake depends upon the rope, and the rope does not depend upon the snake, so also all beings are dependent upon the Lord, but the Lord is not dependent on them. The wave depends on the ocean, but the ocean does not depend on the wave.",
      "When the Lord says that all the qualities (sattva, rajas, tamas) are caused by Him, it is certainly not to encourage tamasic or temperments. or rajasic temperments. The point to note is that the Lord is the final cause of all that exists as objects or qualities."

Enveloped by these qualities, man remains like a worm in a fruit. It can move inside the fruit, but it cannot come out unless the rind is broken. So long as the qualities agitate the mind, the real Self cannot be perceived.",
      "It is necessary first of all to understand the cause of ignorance and know that one is bound. Then only does he make the attempt to regain his freedom. The spiritual aspirant is on a higher plane because he has become conscious of his bondage and is eager to know the truth. This itself is a great step in evolution. The majority of people do not even know that they are slaves to their own lower nature. The aspirant is awakened to his present position as a bound soul, and so he strives to get himself free from the shackles that bind him. Except for the jivanmuktas, all the others – rich and poor, great and small, learned and illiterate – are bound by Maya. The eye cannot see objects when there is a cataract. It should be removed by surgical operation. Then the eye becomes clear and sees things distinctly. Such an operation should be conducted by the spiritual seeker. In this verse, the cause of ignorance is explained. In the nextverse, the way to freedom is pointed out.",

      "Then the Master sang the following song in his melodious voice:",
      "In the world’s busy market-place, O Syama, Thou art flying kites;High up they soar on the wind of hope, held fast by maya’s string.Their frames are human skeletons, their sails of the three gunas made;But all their curious workmanship is merely for ornament.",
      "Upon the kite-strings Thou hast rubbed the manja-paste of worldliness,So as to make each straining strand all the more sharp and strong.Out of a hundred thousand kites, at best but one or two break free;And Thou dost laugh and clap Thy hands, O Mother, watching them!",
      "On favouring winds, says Ramprasad, the kites set loose will speedilyBe borne away to the Infinite, across the sea of the world.",

If all touch her, then how can the game go on? That displeases her. Her pleasure is in continuing the game. Therefore the poet said:",
      "Out of a hundred thousand kites, at best but one or two break free;And Thou dost laugh and clap Thy hands, O Mother, watching them!",
      "“It is as if the Divine Mother said to the human mind in confidence, with a sign from Her eye, ‘Go and enjoy the world.’ How can one blame the mind? The mind can disentangle itself from worldliness if, through Her grace, She makes it turn toward Herself. Only then does it become devoted to the Lotus Feet of the Divine Mother.”",

If you dip them in red dye, they will be red. If you dip them in blue or green, they will be blue or green. They will take only the colour you dip them in, whatever it may be. Haven’t you noticed that, if you read a little English, you at once begin to utter English words: Foot fut it wit? (The Master was merely mimicking the sound of English.) Then you put on boots and whistle a tune, and so on. It all goes together. Or, if a scholar studies Sanskrit, he will at once rattle off Sanskrit verses. If you are in bad company, then you will talk and think like your companions. On the other hand, when you are in the company of devotees, you will think and talk only of God.",

    "commentary": [
      "This verse is of very great importance to all seekers. What is this Maya? What is the way to go beyond it? These two are fundamental questions. The entire universe is under the power of Maya, cosmic illusion. Its true nature should be understood first, then the seeker has to follow the way suggested by the Lord to go beyond it.",
      "Four attributes are mentioned to describe the nature of Maya:",
      "1.Daivi:This cosmic illusion Maya is divine, possessing transcendental power. Maya is of inscrutable, infinite power. Man and the Devas also are deluded by its power, and plunged in the flood of samsara, the cycle of birth and death. Material power, intellectual subtlety, artistic genius, wealth and glory, are all inadequate even to understand it, much less to cross over. Since it is divine, the Divine alone could deal with it.",
      "2.Gunamayi:This Maya is made of three qualities – sattva, rajas, and tamas. Maya has no form. The qualities themselves constitute Maya. If these qualities are removed from the mind, Maya disappears. The whole world is possessed by those qualities and is deluded.",
      "3.Mama:Maya is the supreme power of the Lord. It is under His control and acts according to His command. He may withdraw the power into Himself or project it outside at His will. Though Maya has power to delude the whole universe, yet it is just an instrument in the hands of God. Like servant before the master Maya obeys the Lord. It is inscrutable, mysterious, and wonderful to those who are under its power. To the Lord and the perfected yogis, it is only a non-existent reality. That which is not, that is Maya. That which is non-existent and yet creates the illusion of Reality is Maya. The world is not, yet it appears to exist. The individual self ‘ahamkara’ is not, yet it appears to exist. The reality is covered up and what is unreal is made to appear as the real. Such is the mystery of Maya. But to the wise, it is nothing. The ocean may be difficult to cross for the ordinary man, but to Garutman it is no more than a small canal. He flies over it by the superior power of his wings.",
      "4.Duratyaya:It is difficult to cross over Maya, but it is not impossible. Those who yield to the temptations of sensual pleasures, who are attached to material things cannot cross the ocean of Maya. All spiritual sadhana is intended to eliminate the temptations of the flesh and the delusions of the mind.",
      "Having described the power of Maya in the first line, the Lord points the way to cross over it in the second line. Those who take refuge in the Lord transcend Maya. Devotion to the Lord, and surrender to the Lord is the way to overcome Maya. ‘Surrender to Me. I will take you beyond Maya’. is the Lord’s command. Sankara says that devotion to the Lord’s lotus feet is the strong boat that will carry people beyond the ocean of samsara.",
      "Human skill and intelligence is indeed capable of many worldly victories and achievements. Inventions are made, empires are built, battles are fought and won by human intelligence and skill. But when man stands confronted with the cosmic illusion, he is by himself powerless. Only by surrender to the Supreme Lord, and by His grace alone, can man cross the frontiers of samsara, and enter the land of bliss and blessedness.",
      "Service of the sages and Rishis who had already gone beyond Maya is also of greatest help to the spiritual aspirant. Having crossed the mire of delusion, they help mankind to do so.",
      "The Lord is perfectly clear in his declaration ‘mam eva‘- Me only – is His command. Nothing else, no one else, can work the miracle. If one surrenders to the objective world he will suffer endless misery. If he surrenders to the Lord, he will obtain the highest rewards of freedom and bliss. The choice lies in man. Each one has to take the decision himself. No one can decide for another. The Lord’s promise that he would take man beyond maya, should give infinite strength to man. This verse should be read and re-read, and the divine light by which the enveloping darkness will all be dispelled will flow.",
      "Devotion to the Lord means to have unswerving faith in Him, perform sacred works, meditate on the Self, cultivate virtues, and such other practices that purify the mind.",
      "We find that with all this, with this terrible fact before us, in the midst of sorrow and suffering, even in this world where life and death are synonymous, even here, there is a still small voice that is ringing through all ages, through every country, and in every heart: “This My Maya is divine, made up of qualities, and very difficult to cross. Yet those that come unto Me, cross the river of life.” “Come unto Me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.” This is the voice that is leading us forward. Man has heard it, and is hearing it all through the ages. This voice comes to men when everything seems to be lost and hope has fled, when man’s dependence on his own strength has been crushed down, and everything seems to melt away between his fingers, and life is a hopeless ruin. Then he hears it. This is called religion.[Source]",
      "We have to come to this idea: “This My Maya is divine.” It is My activity [My] divinity. “[My Maya] is hard to cross, but those that take refuge in me [go beyond Maya].” But you find out that it is very difficult to cross this ocean [of Maya by] yourself. You cannot. It is the old question — hen and egg. If you do any work, that work becomes the cause and produces the effect. That effect [again] becomes the cause and produces the effect. And so on. If you push this down, it never stops. Once you set a thing in motion, there is no more stopping. I do some work, good or bad, [and it sets up a chain reaction] … I cannot stop now. It is impossible for us to get out from this bondage [by ourselves].It is only possible if there is someone more powerful than this law of causation, and if he takes mercy on us and drags us out.And we declare that there is such a one — god. There is such a being, all merciful.[Source]",

I asked him, ‘Hriday, why do you tie the calf there every day?’ ‘Uncle,’ he said, ‘I am going to send this calf to our village. When it grows strong I shall yoke it to the plough.’ As soon as I heard these words I was stunned to think: ‘How inscrutable is the play of the divine maya! Kamarpukur and Sihore (Hriday’s birth-place.) are so far away from Calcutta! This poor calf must go all that way. Then it will grow, and at length it will be yoked to the plough. This is indeed the world! This is indeed maya!’ I fell down unconscious. Only after a long time did I regain consciousness.” (Source:Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna)",

Addressing God, the devotee should say, ‘Thou art the Mother and I am Thy child; Thou art the Master and I am Thy servant.’ It is good to have the attitude of the servant toward the master. From this relationship of master and servant spring up other attitudes: the attitude of serene love for God, the attitude of friend toward friend, and so forth. (Source:Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna)",
      "Sri Ramakrishna:“The song speaks of the Kundalini’s passing through the six centres.God is both within and without. From within He creates the various states of mind. After passing through the six centres, the jiva goes beyond the realm of maya and becomes united with the Supreme Soul. This is the vision of God.",
      "“One cannot see God unless maya steps aside from the door. Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita were walking together. Rama was in front, Sita walked in the middle, and Lakshmana followed them. But Lakshmana could not see Rama because Sita was between them. In like manner, man cannot see God because maya is between them. (To Mani Mallick)But maya steps aside from the door when God shows His grace to the devotee.When the visitor stands before the door, the door-keeper says to the master, ‘Sir, command us, and we shall let him pass.’",
      "“There are two schools of thought: the Vedanta and the Purana. According to the Vedanta this world is a ‘framework of illusion’, that is to say, it is all illusory, like a dream. But according to the Purana, the books of devotion, God Himself has become the twenty-four cosmic principles. Worship God both within and without.",
      "“As long as God keeps the awareness of ‘I’ in us, so long do sense-objects exist; and we cannot very well speak of the world as a dream. There is fire in the hearth; therefore the rice and pulse and potatoes and the other vegetables jump about in the pot. They jump about as if to say: ‘We are here! We are jumping!’ This body is the pot. The mind and intelligence are the water. The objects of the senses are the rice, potatoes, and other vegetables. The ‘I-consciousness’ identified with the senses says, ‘I am jumping about.’ And Satchidananda is the fire.",
      "“…But the Bhakti scriptures admit that the manifestations of Power are different in different beings. It is Rama who has become everything, no doubt; but He manifests Himself more in some than in others. There is one kind of manifestation of Rama in the Incarnation of God, and another in men. Even the Incarnations are conscious of the body. Embodiment is due to maya. Rama wept for Sita. But the Incarnation of God puts a bondage over His eyes by His own will, like children playing blindman’s buff. The children stop playing when their mother calls them. It is quite different, however, with the ordinary man. The cloth his eyes are bandaged with is fastened to his back with screws, as it were. There are eight fetters.Shame, hatred, fear, caste, lineage, good conduct, grief, and secretiveness—these are the eight fetters. And they cannot be unfastened without the help of a guru.",

You cannot think of fire without its power to burn, nor can you think of the power to burn without fire. You cannot conceive of the sun’s rays without the sun, nor can you conceive of the sun without its rays.“What is milk like? Oh, you say, it is something white. You cannot think of the milk without the whiteness, and again, you cannot think of the whiteness without the milk.“Thus one cannot think of Brahman without Sakti, or of Sakti without Brahman. One cannot think of the Absolute without the Relative, or of the Relative without the Absolute.“The Primordial Power is ever at play. (This idea introduces the elements of spontaneity and freedom in the creation.) She is creating, preserving, and destroying in play, as it were. This Power is called Kali. Kali is verily Brahman, and Brahman is verily Kali. It is one and the same Reality. When we think of It as inactive, that is to say, not engaged in the acts of creation, preservation, and destruction, then we call It Brahman. But when It engages in these activities, then we call It Kali or Sakti. The Reality is one and the same; the difference is in name and form.[Source]",

Sri Ramakrishna saw the Divine Mother there in the guise of a girl wearing a red-bordered cloth. She was playing with some other girls, catching grasshoppers. Seeing Her, the Master cried out, “Mother, O Mother!” and lost all outer consciousness. Coming back to normal consciousness, he went inside the temple and found the same cloth on the image of the Mother that She had worn while playing as a girl in the bushes. After listening to the Master’s story, Hriday asked:“Uncle, why didn’t you tell me then and there? I would have run and caught hold of Her.”Sri Ramakrishna smiled and said:“Is it so easy?

      "It is declared in the previousversethat those who surrender to the Lord go beyond Maya. But do all people surrender? No. The Lord here describes those who do not come to Him. They are ignorant because their understanding is deluded by Maya. They are the lowest of men. They have taken to demonical nature and act like vile and wretched beings. Maya acts like a thief. If it is allowed to enter the heart, all that is precious – the discrimination, the superior intelligence, the virtue, the sadhana – are stolen in a trice, and people are left helpless and wretched. Man is degraded into a demon. The wise man is transformed into a fool. What is Maya? The bad samskaras, lust, anger, greed, arrogance, pride, and egoism – all these taken together is Maya. Therefore by discrimination, devotion, dispassion, and sacred thoughts and acts, one should guard his inner self from the powerful onslaughts of maya.",

    "commentary": [
      "The devotees of the Lord are classified into four types. All of them worship the Lord. But their aim and purpose are different. They are all righteous people (sukritanah) as distinguished from the opposite type of demonical natures described in the previousverse.",
      "1.Artah:Men in distress remember the Lord and pray to Him for the removal of their difficulties and sorrows. Men suffering from painful diseases cry for the mercy of the Lord to save them. So also, when attacked by dacoits or wild animals, when harassed by wicked people, men call on the Lord to protect them. These form the largest majority of devotees in the world. They seek refuge in various Devas for help and protection. Whatever their nature may be, they remember the Lord sometimes or other, and recognise Him as the Higher power, and so, they are all virtuous- ‘sukritanah’. Gajendra cried for the protection of the Lord when he was caught by the sea-monster. Draupadi did so when she was about to be stripped naked in the Royal Court of Dhritarashtra. The Lord did come down to protect them.",
      "2.Jijnasuh:These are people who are eager to know and understand the Lord. Great research is carried on into the objective world, and people are spending their high intelligence and energy in these material pursuits only. Here and there we come across a research-worker in the field of the Divine. They study the sastras, examine their own nature, seek the guidance of the Guru, and try to find out the ultimate cause of creation, and the basic secret of their own personality. The Lord has already declared that the knowledge-seeker (jijnashu) transcends sastraic knowledge and Vedic ritualism. Such intense yearning to know the truth is the effect of the good done in several births.",
      "3.Artharthi:Men who seek prosperity are the third type of devotees. Their object is to enjoy worldly prosperity in the various fields of human life. Naturally, they seek the benevolence of the Lord to confer prosperity on them. They are also the devotees of the Lord.",
      "It is to be noted that the infinite compassion of the Lord is also open for people who desire material comforts, unopposed to the law of Dharma.",
      "4.Jnani:The man of knowledge knows the real nature of the Lord, and is able to discriminate between the true and the illusory. He has attained the Self-state and lives in constant absorption in Atma. Unlike the ‘arta’ and ‘artharthi’ he has no fears and no desires. He loves the Lord because he knows that He is the only Reality in the universe, that He is the repository of all wisdom and bliss. He has nothing to gain for himself, and so his devotion to the Lord is a spontaneous act of oneness with Him.",
      "Thus the four classes of men are included among the Lord’s devotees. They are all righteous men. Among ‘arta’ bhaktas we have the example of Gajendra and Draupadi; among the ‘jijnasu’ bhaktas Parikshit, Udahava, and others; among the ‘Artharthi’ bhaktas Sugriva, Dhruva, and others; and among the jnani’ bhaktas Suka, Narada, Bhishma, Prahlada and others.",
      "MASTER:“It is not good to feel that one’s own religion alone is true and all others are false. God is one only, and not two. Different people call on Him by different names: some as Allah, some as God, and others as Krishna, Siva, and Brahman. It is like the water in a lake. Some drink it at one place and call it ‘jal’, others at another place and call it ‘pani’, and still others at a third place and call it ‘water’. The Hindus call it ‘jal’, the Christians ‘water’, and the Mussalmans ‘pani’. But it is one and the same thing. Opinions are but paths. Each religion is only a path leading to God, as rivers come from different directions and ultimately become one in the one ocean.",
      "“The Truth established in the Vedas, the Puranas, and the Tantras is but one Satchidananda. In the Vedas It is called Brahman, in the Puranas It is called Krishna, Rama, and so on, and in the Tantras It is called Siva. The one Satchidananda is called Brahman, Krishna, and Siva.”",
      "“…… Again, there are different levels among the devotees of God: superior, mediocre, and inferior. All this has been described in the Gita.”",
      "VAISHNAVA:“True, sir.”",
      "MASTER:“The inferior devotee says, ‘God exists, but He is very far off, up there in heaven.’ The mediocre devotee says, ‘God exists in all beings as life and consciousness.’ The superior devotee says: ‘It is God Himself who has become everything; whatever I see is only a form of God. It is He alone who has become maya, the universe, and all living beings. Nothing exists but God.(BG 7.17)'”(Source:Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna)"

      "The jnani is declared to be the highest of the Lord’s devotees because he possesses two qualities not found in the other types. Firstly, he is constantly absorbed in the Self, and secondly, he is devoted to the Lord only and nothing else in the world.",
      "1.Nitya yuktah– The jnani who has realised the Self is always in contact with the Lord. The others think of the Lord now and then. They are part-time devotees; they think of the Lord for some time and then go back to their daily activities of life. But the Jnani has no worldy activities to divert his mind from the Self. So he is ever united with the Lord ‘Nityayuktah’. Though in the early stages, the devotee’s mind vacillates between the Lord and worldly life, yet it is quite possible gradually to develop constant devotion and since the Jnani has achieved this, he is declared to be the best of the devotees.",
      "2.ekabhaktih –The Jnani is devoted only to the Lord. He has no attachment to anything else in the world. The others have desires and fears, because they are attached to the world, and think of the Lord for help and protection. The Jnani on the other hand has already found out the illusory nature of the world, and so he has no attraction for anything like wealth or family, name or glory which usually tempt the ignorant. He knows the One Supreme Reality, and his mind is absorbed in it. The Lord is dear to him, and he is dear to the Lord. The closeness of the relationship between the Lord and the devotee is indicated here. Nothing can stand in between the two. In fact, the world stands between man and God. The Jnani has removed this mighty obstacle from his way and has come so close to the Lord that he and his Master become one. When the Lord is pleased with his devotee, what more does he want? The reward of God’s love is moksha.",
      "In the ultimate analysis, there can be no difference between Jnana and Bhakti. That is what is implied in the single-minded devotion of the Jnani. It is only in the early stages of Sadhana that Jnana and devotion appear to be different, but as a man rises to higher and higher spiritual planes, he discovers the truth, that the Supreme Lord of the devotee and the Brahman of the Jnani are only two different names for the same One.",
      "Four sorts of people worship Me. Some want the delights of the physical world. Some want money, some want religion. Some worship Me because they love Me. Real love is love for love’s sake. I do not ask health or money or life or salvation. Send me to a thousand hells, but let me love Thee for love’s sake. Mira Bai, the great queen, taught the doctrine of love for love’s sake.[Source]",
      "Miserable are the diseased people; they are great worshippers of the Lord, for they hope that if they pray to Him He will heal them. Not that that is altogether bad — if such prayers are honest and if they remember that that is not religion. Shri Krishna says in the Gita, “Four classes of people worship Me: the distressed, the seeker of material things, the inquirer, and the knower of truth.” People who are in distress approach God for relief. If they are ill, they worship Him to be healed; if they lose their wealth, they pray to Him to get it back. There are other people who ask Him for all kinds of things, because they are full of desires — name, fame, wealth, position and so on. They will say, “O Virgin Mary, I will make an offering to you if I get what I want. If you are successful in granting my prayer, I will worship God and give you a part of everything.” Men not so material as that, but still with no faith in God, feel inclined to know about Him. They study philosophies, read scriptures, listen to lectures, and so on. They are the inquirers. The last class are those who worship God and know Him. All these four classes of people are good, not bad. All of them worship Him.[Source]",
      "Various sorts of worship we see in this world. The sick man is very worshipful to God. … There is the man who loses his fortune; he also prays very much, to get money. The highest worship is that of the man who loves God for God’s sake.[Source]",

Then all your efforts to bring the water by digging a canal will be futile.",
      "“You will feel restless for God when your heart becomes pure and your mind free from attachment to the things of the world. Then alone will your prayer reach God. A telegraph wire cannot carry messages if it has a break or some other defect.",

      "“One must not cherish any desire whatever. The devotion of a man who has any desire is selfish. But desireless devotion is love for its own sake. You may love me or not, but I love you: this is love for its own sake.",
      "“The thing is that one must love God. Through intense love one attains the vision of Him. The attraction of the husband for the chaste wife, the attraction of the child for its mother, the attraction of worldly possessions for the worldly man — when a man can blend these three into one, and direct it all to God, then he gets the vision of God.” (Source:Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna)",

God alone is real, and all else illusory.“While Arjuna was aiming his arrow at the eye of the bird, Drona asked him: ‘What do you see? Do you see these kings?’ ‘No, sir’, replied Arjuna. ‘Do you see me?’ ‘No.’ ‘The tree?’ ‘No.’ ‘The bird on the tree?’ ‘No.’ ‘What do you see then?’ ‘Only the eye of the bird.’“He who sees only the eye of the bird can hit the mark.

      "The knower of Brahman becomes Brahman. So is the Jnani, the Lord Himself. The others are dualistic in their attitude. They think of themselves as separate from the Lord and worship Him as a superior Being. This is quite natural in the early stages of Sadhana. When the aspirant is enthroned in yoga he knows that he is not separate from the Lord. That is why the Jnani is described as harmonised in mind, ‘yuktatma’. The Jnani knows that the Lord is his supreme goal. He has no desire and attachment for anything else. He has discovered the illusory nature of the world. And so, the Lord is the only Reality for him. With an unswerving mind, he thinks, lives, moves and has his being in the Lord. That is why the Jnani is worshipped as the Lord Himself. Vyasa is described as Vishnu Himself with two arms. Though such men dwell in a mortal body, they are verily God. Where is God to be found? The answer definitely is that –God is found in His devotee, the Jnani. Whatever path is followed – karma, bhakti, jnana or dhyana – the final goal is union with the Supreme Being. All Sadhana finds its ultimate fulfillment in the realisation of oneness with the Lord.",

Several births pass away in a state of ignorance. And then, the desire to know the truth is born in the heart of man. Even then, several births pass away in the ups and downs of spiritual Sadhana. Ultimately man realises the truth, that everything is God. So long as there is the slightest trace of differentiation knowledge is imperfect. Perfection of jnana is the discovery that there is only One and that is God, and there is nothing but He in the whole universe. Sages of such realisation are indeed very rare.",
      "But it would be foolish to be lazy and dull in spiritual sadhana, because realisation can come only after many births. On the other hand, knowing full well that he has passed through millions of births, man should strive for liberation even in this very birth. The test of knowledge is the recognition of God everywhere. So long as the objective world ‘drisya’ dominates the mind causing contradictory feelings of attraction and repulsion, there is no knowledge. The aspirant should intensify his sadhana till he comes to know without any doubt that what has been appearing as the objective world is nothing but the Lord Himself.",

Ripeness of mind is all that is needed.",

      "A boy named Vishnu, living in Ariadaha, had recently committed suicide by cutting his throat with a razor. The talk turned to him.MASTER:“I felt very badly when I heard of the boy’s passing away. He was a pupil in a school and he used to come here. He would often say to me that he couldn’t enjoy worldly life. He had lived with some relatives in the western provinces and at that time used to meditate in solitude, in the meadows, hills, and forests. He told me he had visions of many divine forms.“Perhaps this was his last birth. He must have finished most of his duties in his previous birth. The little that had been left undone was perhaps finished in this one.“One must admit the existence of tendencies inherited from previous births. There is a story about a man who practised the sava-sadhana. (A religious practice prescribed by the Tantra, in which the aspirant uses a sava, or corpse, as his seat for meditation.) He worshipped the Divine Mother in a deep forest. First he saw many terrible visions. Finally a tiger attacked and killed him. Another man, happening to pass and seeing the approach of the tiger, had climbed a tree. Afterwards he got down and found all the arrangements for worship at hand. He performed some purifying ceremonies and seated himself on the corpse. No sooner had he done a little japa than the Divine Mother appeared before him and said: ‘My child, I am very much pleased with you. Accept a boon from Me.’ He bowed low at the Lotus Feet of the Goddess and said: ‘May I ask You one question, Mother? I am speechless with amazement at Your action. The other man worked so hard to get the ingredients for Your worship and tried to propitiate You for such a long time, but You didn’t condescend to show him Your favour. And I, who don’t know anything of worship, who have done nothing, who have neither devotion nor knowledge nor love, and who haven’t practised any austerities, am receiving so much of Your grace.’ The Divine Mother said with a laugh;‘My child, you don’t remember your previous births.(BG 4.5) For many births you tried to propitiate Me through austerities. As a result of those austerities all these things have come to hand, and you have been blessed with My vision. Now ask Me your boon.'”",

He was saying:“Thou art I, and I am Thou — Thou eatest — Thou — I eat! . . . What is this confusion Thou hast created?”Continuing, the Master said:“I see everything like a man with jaundiced eyes! I see Thee alone everywhere. O Krishna, Friend of the lowly! O Eternal Consort of my soul! O Govinda!”As he uttered the words “Eternal Consort of my soul” and “Govinda”, the Master again went into samadhi. There was complete silence in the room.

Then like a madman I began to shower flowers in all directions.

After that my worship of Siva through the image came to an end. Another day I had been plucking flowers, when it was revealed to me that the flowering plants were so many bouquets.” (Source:Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna)",

      "There was an ascetic, who worshipped God Ganesā. He had an idol of Ganesā, and another one of a rat, both made of gold. Both of theseweighed equally. Once the ascetic decided to go on a pilgrimage, He went to a goldsmith to sell them. The goldsmith weighed them and told the ascetic, that the value of each of the two was the same. At this the ascetic grew angry with the goldsmith and asked him how a vehicle could be equal, in value to the Lord. The goldsmith replied. “Sir, I am not buying either God Ganesā, or his vehicle, the rat. I buy gold. So I shall pay you according to their weight” ‘Thus, as a goldsmith does not notice Lord Ganesā or his vehicle, he sees only gold. So does a great soul behold God, he does not, see the world.

Since this universal vision is hard to acquire, men are given infinite choice to worship any form which appeals to their imagination, according to their past samskaras. The only condition is that there should be faith in the worship. Progress should be maintained whether the pace is slow or quick. And also, the destination should be kept in view, and there should be no deviation or back-sliding.

The separate form as Krishna or Rama is His own creation, and when the purpose of His Avatara is fulfilled, the form is dissolved and He remains the Eternal. The devotees are blessed by such Avataras. But unfortunately, the ignorant men of little intelligence consider the name and form of the Lord as His real nature, and so, they do not find Him different from other mortals. No doubt the devotees are endowed with faith and devotion when they see the manifestation of the Lord as Rama or Krishna. But they should Know the higher nature (Parambhavam) of the Lord, and should not get confused.",
      "Four attributes are mentioned about the higher nature of the Lord. (1) He is unknowable (Avykta). (2) He is transcendental (param). (3) He is imperishable (Avyayam). (4) He is supreme (Anúttamam). He is unknowable by the senses and the mind. The phenomenal world is visible to the senses and comprehensible by the mind. If the Lord also is a composition of the elements, he would dissolve like any other mortal form. But he is imperishable. He is subtler than any other. The material sky (Akasa) is itself invisible and so how can the Lord whose nature is more subtle (Chidakasa) be an object of perception? He is the whole universe, but he is at the same time not bound by physical laws because He is transcendental. Since He is beyond time and place, and is uncontaminated by material elements, since He is not subject to dissolution like other things, He is described as Supreme, most excellent (Anuttama).",
      "It should be clearly understood that this verse is not a disparagement of the worship of the different manifestations of the Lord in temples and images. The common devotee must go through this process of fixing some form of the Lord in the mind and worshipping Him in that manner. But he should not stop there. As his vision enlarges and his devotion deepens, he will naturally evolve towards the transcendental perfection of the Lord. Devotion of this type is commendable.",

It was Bhishma who could understand the transcendental nature of the Lord, while he appeared in the beautiful form of Krishna. Bhishma could worship the Lord as Krishna, and at the same time know that He is the imperishable Paramatma. Ravana could think of Sri Rama only as a mortal, subject to death like any other. But sages like Vasishta and others could understand that Sri Rama is the Lord Himself appearing as the Prince of Ayodhya. It is this understanding which is suggested in the verse for the guidance of all seekers. (Verse 6.4)",

      "If God is Omnipresent, why does He not manifest to all. This question is frequently asked by many. The answer is here. He is veiled by his own power (Sakti), the cosmic illusion, and so He is not seen by all. To those for whom the veil is drawn off by intense discrimination, He becomes visible. Between man and God, there is the veil of cosmic illusion. It is Maya composed of the three qualities (Sattva, Rajas and Tamas). The veil of ‘Tamas’ is dark, that of Rajas is red, and that of Sattva is pure white. Thus the threefold veil covers up the effulgent Paramatma. As the devotee tears away veil after veil by intense sadhana, the Reality behind manifests itself as the final Truth.All the spiritual practices are intended to remove the obstruction that stands between man and God, and not to produce or create God! He is already there, the eternal conscious principle in all.The problem simply is to clear off the veil of Maya. The power of maya and how to cross over it has already been declared by the Lord (6-14).",
      "When a dark pot is placed over the lamp, light is not seen. When the pot is taken off, the light is visible. When one covers his eyes with his hands, he cannot see the Sun. When he takes off its hands, he sees the Sun. Therefore, though the Lord is present in all, He is not seen: It is true to say that what one sees as the objective world is also the Lord, but such is the power of the cosmic illusion that he is confused and thinks of the world only as matter and nothing more. When the mind is cleared of the illusion he sees everything as the Lord. (Vasudevas sarvamiti).",
      "The ignorant are strengthening maya and forging strong shackles to bind themselves. Lust and sensuality, indulgence in sense-pleasures, greed and hatred – these are haunting the mind of humanity, and purity and self-control are at a discount. The unrest in the world is due to the clouded intelligence of men who are not able to understand the secret of peace and blessedness. Spiritual life and inner freedom have practically become impossible for many because the atmosphere in which people live is poisoned with sense attractions and distracting elements. Blessed are the few who, in the midst of this uproar and agitation, have set their aim on perfection, and strive for it with discrimination and dispassion. They shall see the higher nature of the Lord.",
      "The word ‘sarvasya‘ (to all) here should refer only to the ignorant. That the Lord is veiled by maya is from the dualistic point only. Paramatma has no veil by which He is covered. He is unclouded pure Supreme Intelligence. The veil is for the individual Jiva only. The clouds cannot at any time affect the sun. He is always bright and glorious. The covering of the clouds is from the viewpoint of those who are below the clouds. The same is the case with the Supreme Lord.",
      "A different interpretation of the phrase “Yogamaya-samavritah” (Veiled by Yoga Maya) is given by some commentators. It is taken as a qualifying adjective to‘mudhah’(the deluded). Then the meaning would be the ignorant world veiled by the deluding power of Maya is not able to see the eternal nature of the Lord.",

And He revealed to me what is in the Vedas, the Puranas, the Tantras, and the other scriptures.“One day He showed me the maya of Mahamaya. A small light inside a room began to grow, and at last it enveloped the whole universe.“Further, He revealed to me a huge reservoir of water covered with green scum. The wind moved a little of the scum and immediately the water became visible; but in the twinkling of an eye, scum from all sides came dancing in and again covered the water. He revealed to me that the water was like Satchidananda, and the scum like maya.On account of maya, Satchidananda is not seen. Though now and then one may get a glimpse of It, again maya covers It.(Source:Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna)",

    "commentary": [
      "The Omniscience of the Lord is here declared. All beings are in the womb of time, and time as the cosmic illusion, is in the Lord. As the whole universe from creation to dissolution is functioning in the Lord, there is nothing that He does not know. His eye is on all beings, past, present, and future. Knowing this, how can man commit sin?",
      "By contrast with the Omniscience of the Supreme Iswara, we understand the limited character of the individual Jiva. He is controlled by time. He is subject to death and change. He does not know the past or the future. His understanding is limited to very small things around him. Whereas the Lord is ‘Sarvajna’ (omniscient) the individual Jiva is ‘Kinchijna’ (of little knowledge).",
      "The Lord is eternal, beyond time, all-knowing. What is man after all in the presence of the Lord? And yet this little man is proud of his strength, position, wealth, beauty and knowledge. He thinks that he is everything and thus has no thought of the Lord. This is the illusory power of Maya working on the human mind. He who knows the truth sings the infinite glory of the Lord with a hundred tongues. He prostrates himself before the Lord with deep faith and devotion. When a common mortal exhibits some ray of genius, people honour him and pay homage to him. That being so, what is the homage that man should pay to the Omniscient Lord with all His infinite power. It is the primary duty of man to contemplate the transcendental glory of the Lord, His omniscience, omnipotence, and His imperishable nature. Pride and egoism cannot have any place in the heart of the spiritual aspirant.",
      "Mam tu veda na Kaschana– No one knows me. This should refer to men of demonical nature who have no faith in the Lord, who have no Self-knowledge and who are devoid of devotion. It is true that the Lord alone knows His full glory. The rest, the highest of his devotees, men of perfect knowledge, are one with Him. Standing at the screened window of his high palace, the King can see the crowds below, but not one of the crowd can see the King in the palace. So also, the Lord knows all beings, but very few know Him. Therefore it is the duty of man to understand his limitations and the unlimited power of the Lord, to have faith in Him, and to cross the ocean of samsara by His grace. As the raindrop merges in the ocean, so should the individual self merge in Him. This is Moksha, perfect freedom. Till then like the animal bound to the tether, man’s life is limited by a thousand restricting influences.",
      "māṃ tu veda na kaścana— no one knows Me. These words have a deep spiritual implication. ‘Knowing’ happens when the mind flows out through the senses and meets the other. Such knowing is impossible in the case of Existence, one’s own Self. The only way to know the Lord is to be the Lord; that is, you cease to exist as a person; only He exists. That is the way of God-Realisation. Sri Ramana Maharshi says, “To be the Self is to see the Self. There are no two Selves, one to see the other. That is Ātmanishṭhā—abidance in the Self.”",
      "आत्मसंस्थितिः स्वात्मदर्शनम्।आत्मनिर्द्वयादात्मनिष्ठता॥ Upa.Sa. 26",
      "When one beholds the world too as God—seeing everything as Vāsudeva—it is not seeing in the usual sense. No beholding and no seeing happens there. There is no holding on to anything at all because there is no working of the intellect there. There is no thought process, because the moment the whole world becomes the Atman—ātmaiva abhūt—the thinking process comes to a halt. A kind of spontaneity alone exists, just like the natural spontaneity with which the right hand goes to help an itchy left hand. The whole world is you. You experience it as Existence. The Upanishad says,* “No one can know Me because I am the Knower. No one can see Me because I am the Seer.” You cannot see the Seer; you cannot know the Knower; you can just be.",
      "The Master was still in the ecstatic mood. Suddenly he said to M: “Look here, you have had enough of reasoning. No more of it. Promise that you won’t reason any more.”M. (with folded hands):“Yes, sir. I won’t.”MASTER:“You have had enough of it. When you came to me the first time, I told you your spiritual Ideal. I know everything about you, do I not?”M. (with folded hands): “Yes, sir.”MASTER:“Yes,I know everything: what your Ideal is, who you are, your inside and outside, the events of your past lives, and your future.Do I not?”M. (with folded hands):“Yes, sir.”MASTER:“I scolded you on learning that you had a son. Now go home and live there. Let them know that you belong to them. But you must remember in your heart of hearts that you do not belong to them nor they to you.” (Source:Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna)",

      "O Arjuna! By the delusion of pairs of opposites caused by desire and aversion, all beings are subject to illusion in the world."
    ],
    "commentary": [
      "All people are enveloped in ignorance from the time of birth. The Lord’s Yogamaya casts her veil around the new-born baby in the cradle. It is deep and impenetrable darkness that shrouds the human being, preventing him from seeing the light of Atma. What is this delusion? It is the delusion of the pairs of opposites like pleasure and pain, heat and cold, etc., arising from desire and aversion. Freedom from attraction and revulsion (raga and dvesha) will eliminate the pairs of opposites.When there is no desire to enjoy a particular object, there cannot be any pain resulting from the non-possession of that object, nor the hatred against those who stand in the way of such enjoyment.Desire agitates the mind and makes it restless, and a restless mind is far away from peace which is the only condition for Self-realisation. Even if the desire is fulfiled, the desire itself will not die with its gratification. It seeks more and more enjoyment and there is no end to desires. So this subtle and powerful enemy should be fought with discrimination and dispassion and rooted out of the mind.",
      "Dislike towards an unpleasant object is common to all. The mind constantly fluctuates between likes and dislikes. When a pleasing thing comes to a person he is happy, but soon after when something unpleasant occurs, he is pained. Thus the whole world is divided into two opposite extremes for the common man. So long as there is pleasure, there will be pain also. So long as there is joy there shall be unhappiness also. After very long experience, man discovers that he cannot have the one without the other, and his search for a painless pleasure is the fool’s search for the hare’s horn which does not exist. Then will he seek for that joy which is self-existent, which is the very Self of men. There he finds a bliss which is uncontaminated; there finds the light that has no shadow; there he finds the peace which nothing can disturb. This state must come to all sooner or later.",
      "The cosmic illusion overtakes man even from the time of birth. As man grows, the illusion takes a stronger hold on him. It is true that in childhood, desire and aversion are less powerful and so spiritual sadhana should start even from childhood, before the mind is poisoned by worldy desires, ambitions, enjoyments and so on. All great Mahatmas have practised spiritual discipline from their childhood when the mind is not positively attached to worldly things.",
      "Arjuna is addressed as the ‘scorcher of enemies’ for he has destroyed many of the powerful enemies, and so he should strive hard to root out the invisible foes who had taken possession of his heart.",
      "All beings are under delusion at birth, but some awakened souls transcend the illusion by devotion and knowledge.",
      "Question:What is the source of the pairs of opposites?",
      "Answer:Desire and aversion (Raga and Dvesha)",
      "Question:When does delusion overtake all beings?",
      "Answer:Even at the time of birth."

      "But those men of good works whose sin has come to an end, worship Me steadfast in vows, freed from the delusive pairs of opposites."
    ],
    "commentary": [
      "Only the man who is steadfast in his vows can worship the Lord and understand His higher nature. Vows of silence, fasting, celibacy, study and others are practised by many for self-perfection. But to acquire steadfast discipline is difficult. The reason is that the mind is impure by accumulated sins of several births. This is the chief obstacle in spiritual life. As the dirty cloth cannot be dyed, as no seed grows in the wasteland, so also spiritual illumination does not arise in the heart of the sinful man. Sin is the manifestation of ‘rajo guna’ and this does not allow a man to remain still in the contemplation of the Self. The Mind is turned outward to wander in the wildness of the world.",
      "So the mind should be washed pure. And this is possible by performing good deeds, ‘Do Punya karma and destroy sin‘-that is the Lord’s command. The seeker should do good deeds continuously. Some charity, some service to suffering-humanity, some self-sacrifice for the sake of others, some japa and some kind of spiritual discipline should be done by him. This is the only way to eliminate sin.It is foolish to say that even good karma binds. Bad can be removed only by good, and in the final stages of Realisation, both bad and good are left behind.But even after Realisation the Lord has ordained that good works should be continued for the sake of setting an example for humanity. The man of good deeds shall never fall to a low state says the Lord.",
      "Those who have destroyed sin by good deeds, are freed from the delusive pairs of opposites, and worship the Lord with unswerving devotion. Thus they realise the Self and attain Moksha.",
      "Vows firmly held and practised with a resolute spirit are necessary for progress. A weak and, vacillating mind cannot achieve anything. The obstruction of Maya cannot be easily removed. The Sadhaka should fix the discipline and follow it. “I will not touch food till I complete some Japa, and read a chapter of the Gita of Ramayana or some other sacred work.” Thus he should determine and act.",

      "The individual strives for liberation from the ills and sorrows of life and for obtaining that bliss which is perfect. All spiritual practices and surrender to the Lord, have this freedom and perfection as the goal. As the seeker continues his practice, and as his sadhana becomes ripe, (i.e.) as he becomes a Yogarudhah, he will discover that all things, all knowledge, and all action to be Brahman, and that there is nothing else but that. They see the whole life and universe as the Self, Atma, or Brahman.",
      "The knowledge of Brahman does not come to all. Those who are awakened to the ills of life, who seek liberation, who strive for it, who take refuge in the Lord, they alone understand the highest Truth-that the Self is Brahman and everything is only that and nothing else. Man realises that his limited self is only a fiction, a myth and mirage, and what exists is only Brahman, and he is that (Aham Brahmasmi).",
      "Asritya, yatani:These two are the key-words of the verse. They go together, striving for liberation and surrendering to the Lord. Both these are necessary for Brahma-Jnana. When man strives for knowledge, God’s grace helps him to know the right path and reach the goal.",

    "commentary": [
      "When the seeker attains Brahmajnana, he understands that everything pertaining to the elements, the Gods, and the sacrifices, is all comprehended by Brahman. He retains that experience even at the time of death. All indeed is Brahman and the Self is Brahman. Such knowledge is acquired through a whole life-time of sadhana, and that experience ‘I am Brahman’ is remembered at the moment of death also. If one fills the mind with worldly thoughts, those very thoughts occur at the time of death. If he is merged in the highest realisation, that memory will be powerful at the time of the dissolution of the body.",
      "That is why it is declared here that the man of self-control ‘Yuktachetasa‘ alone can retain that knowledge at the time of death. It does not mean that the memory of the Lord should be held only at the last moment. When man is healthy and strong, when the body is fresh and vigorous, all spiritual sadhana should be done and realisation attained. It is only then that the memory of the blissful experience remains fresh in the mind even at the last moments. As the moment of death is unknown, it follows that spiritual life should be completed when the body is in a fit condition. The Lord gives no concession to the idlers and the negligent. Besides this, the responsibility is placed fully on the personal effort of man for self-realisation. Otherwise, man is likely to live in a fool’s paradise, that some great experience would come to him of its own accord. Every seeker should understand clearly that his own effort will bring down God’s grace to help him towards final realisation.",
