The blossoms of a huge tree are innumerable. But only a few develop fruits. All the others drop off. Among those that bear the fruit, many fall away before the fruits become ripe. And at last, we can pick only a few ripe fruits. It is the same with spiritual aspirants. Devotion, intimate contact with the Lord, is the reward of much good done through several births.",

    "commentary": "The five elements, the mind, reason and egoism together constitute the phenomenal aspect of the Lord’s nature. Prakriti (phenominal nature) is gross and so it is Jada (insentient). Purusha, Atma, or Brahman, is the life-principle. Prakriti is the objective universe (drisya) and Purusha is the seer (drik). Prakriti is liable to destruction, but Purusha is eternal. Mind, reason and egoism are also included in Prakrifi along with the grosser elements. The elements are insentient and so the modifications of internal nature are also insentient. When it is known that the mind is insentient, its power and virulence are lost. It is held and controlled like any other material object. The insentient can never have power over the sentient. Those who do not know this secret come under the power of the mind and dance to its tune. So to control the mind, one should clearly distinguish between the gross and the sentient, and between that which is Jada’ and that which is ‘Chit’.",

    "translation": "O Arjuna! This is the inferior (described in the previous verse), Know My other nature, the Higher – Para Prakriti, the life-element by which the universe is upheld.",
    "commentary": "The Lord now explains the ‘Para Prakriti’ the Higher Nature. It is the life-element by which the whole universe is upheld. Even this, like the ‘apara prakriti‘ is under the control of the Lord, the Purusha. Let us understand the distinction between theparaandaparaPrakriti by means of an illustration.There is a pot filled with water, and the orb of the Sun is reflected in it. Here the pot and water are apara Prakriti- inferior nature, and the reflected orb of the sun shining in the water is para prakriti, Higher nature. The pot stands for the body, the water for the mind, and the reflected sun for the individual self (ego) by which man is deluded into thinking that he is a distinct and real personality. The real sun shining in the sky is Atma, Pursha, the Lord. When the pot and water are destroyed, the sun is not at all affected by it. He shines in his own pristine glory.So the falling away of the body does not make any difference to Atma which is Eternal. Sankaracharya in the Viveka Chudamani explains this idea very clearly.",

    "commentary": "Prakriti in its two aspects, para and apara, is the womb of all beings. Purusha is the Master and cause of all creation, sustenance, and destruction of the entire universe. Prakriti is the instrument with which he creates, maintains, and destroys the whole universe. Therefore tracing back to the root cause of all things, we find that the whole manifested universe and the unmanifested will be found to come out of Brahman and got dissolved in Brahman. The Omnipotent, Omniscient Brahman is the material and efficient cause of the universe. According to the Advaitic concept, the Supreme Self is just the witness of all creation and destruction and is not affected by them.",

To show this truth, the Lord takes certain objects and explains how He is present in them. He is in the form of taste in water, light in the sun and the moon, Pranava (OM) in the Vedas, and virility in men. Thus His presence is to be realised in all things. Taste and water, light and the sun, are inseparable. There is light where there is sun. We cannot conceive the sun without his light. Since it is difficult to conceive the universal presence of the Lord in the beginning, He illustrates the idea with reference to certain objects.",

    "commentary": "Bijam– The Lord declares that He is the seed, the cause of all beings. From Him, the seed, all beings have come, and unto Him they return. The tree is only another form of the seed. The life-force of the whole tree is already involved in the seed. The seed manifests its life-force in the new form of the tree. Even so, the Lord is the seed of all beings. It is He who is manifesting Himeself in different forms. The essence is He in every thing. Thus knowing the wise man transcends all separateness that appears to exist between one thing and another. Whoever he may be, to whatever caste or creed he may belong, high or low, the seed for him is God Himself. He is the cause of He is the father of all. So all beings in essence are God, for there is nothing else but He in the whole universe. He is the cause, and He is also the effect, and the effect is actually the cause in a different form. Knowing this, let no man imagine himself to be weak, neglected, forlorn and wretched. He is God Himself. By ignorance, he has misunderstood himself to be a limited body and a limited personality. Inspired by the words of the Lord let man throw away the veil of ignorance, and know himself as he really is (i.e.) the Supreme Brahman.",

    "commentary": "Strength is the glory of man, but it should be free from desire and passion. Strength should not be abused to satisfy sensual desires and greedy acquisition of worldly possessions. It should be expressed in doing good and benevolent acts, in the worship of the Divine, and in the pursuit of spiritual illumination. Whether it is intellectual or physical strength, if it is employed for selfish purposes to serve the lower impulses, it is wretched. In such cases, it is only demonical might, an asuric force, leading to self-destruction. The might of Ravana was impure by Kama, and it lead to his destruction and that of his people. So purity in strength, nobility in might, is what the Lord wants people to cultivate. His presence is felt in such strength.",

So the existence of Paramatma makes the existence of everything possible. Minus Paramatma, nothing can exist. The universe as we see it with all its panoramic changes is the creative power of the Lord. In the same way as the snake in the rope is sustained by the rope itself, the Lord is the cause of the illusory universe, and just as the rope is really a rope even during the time of one’s illusion, so also the Lord is Himself of the universe whether one realises it or not. Just as the snake depends upon the rope, and the rope does not depend upon the snake, so also all beings are dependent upon the Lord, but the Lord is not dependent on them.

He is veiled by his own power (Sakti), the cosmic illusion, and so He is not seen by all. To those for whom the veil is drawn off by intense discrimination, He becomes visible. Between man and God, there is the veil of cosmic illusion. It is Maya composed of the three qualities (Sattva, Rajas and Tamas). The veil of ‘Tamas’ is dark, that of Rajas is red, and that of Sattva is pure white. Thus the threefold veil covers up the effulgent Paramatma. As the devotee tears away veil after veil by intense sadhana, the Reality behind manifests itself as the final Truth.All the spiritual practices are intended to remove the obstruction that stands between man and God, and not to produce or create God! He is already there, the eternal conscious principle in all.The problem simply is to clear off the veil of Maya. The power of maya and how to cross over it has already been declared by the Lord (6-14).",

It is deep and impenetrable darkness that shrouds the human being, preventing him from seeing the light of Atma. What is this delusion? It is the delusion of the pairs of opposites like pleasure and pain, heat and cold, etc., arising from desire and aversion. Freedom from attraction and revulsion (raga and dvesha) will eliminate the pairs of opposites.When there is no desire to enjoy a particular object, there cannot be any pain resulting from the non-possession of that object, nor the hatred against those who stand in the way of such enjoyment.Desire agitates the mind and makes it restless, and a restless mind is far away from peace which is the only condition for Self-realisation. Even if the desire is fulfiled, the desire itself will not die with its gratification. It seeks more and more enjoyment and there is no end to desires.

Vows of silence, fasting, celibacy, study and others are practised by many for self-perfection. But to acquire steadfast discipline is difficult.

As the dirty cloth cannot be dyed, as no seed grows in the wasteland, so also spiritual illumination does not arise in the heart of the sinful man. Sin is the manifestation of ‘rajo guna’ and this does not allow a man to remain still in the contemplation of the Self. The Mind is turned outward to wander in the wildness of the world.",
