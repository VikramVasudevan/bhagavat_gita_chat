Anandagiri, Sankarananda and others give the meaning ‘limitless’ to the wordaparyaptam, Sridhara and others give the opposite meaning ‘limited’. But it appears that the first meaning is more appropriate to the context, and is consistent with the earlier estimate given by Duryodhana. In the Udyoga Parva (54, 60, 70) and in the Bhishma Parva (51-4-6) Duryodhana, speaking to his father and Drona respectively glorifies the strength of his own army. There is every reason why he should speak well of his own army in the present situation, when they are about to fight the battle. It should also be remembered that in the Bhishma Parva speaking to Drona, Duryodhana utters exactly the same verse while estimating the superior power of his own army",

    "commentary": "Bhishma was the most powerful hero well capable of protecting himself. Why should Duryodhana caution others to keep him safe and well-protected? There is a reason for it. The son of Drupada, Sikhandi, was first a eunuch. Bhishma has pledged that he would never face a eunuch in battle. So, if the Pandavas should place Sikhandi at the foremost point of their army, Bhishma would not face it, and so his power would be partially neutralised. Taking advantage of it, the enemies might injure and kill him. Duryodhana knew the secret. So he directs all the leaders of his army to see that Sikhandi is kept out of the way, so that Bhishma would be free to fight at his best. If Bhishma was safe, he would be able to make the most powerful onslaught on the enemy, and be the bulwark of defense for the entire Kaurava army. Knowing this he directed all to protect Bhishma in all possible ways.",

So Arjuna refers to him as a wicked man. ‘Buddhi nasat pranasyati‘. The Lord declares that man perishes when he loses the power of discrimination. Therefore the epithet ‘durbuddhi’ is indicative of the impending destruction of Duryodhana. It is a warning to all those whose mental disposition is darkened by evil propensities, that, like Duryodhana, they would ruin themselves by defeat, disgrace and death. Let everybody therefore strive for purity of mind and heart for spiritual progress.",

The Lord said: “Behold these Kauravas.” The Kauravas were closely related and Arjuna was naturally moved by feelings of sorrow and despair when he saw them. The situation is thus most congenial for the spiritual teaching of the Lord, and the birth of the Gita is indeed the highest blessing for all mankind.",

His material and physical powers are just the same as before. But mentally he suffered a tremendous shock. Why? by the thought born of = Avidya these are my men, how can I kill them?

He may have the following reasons to come to such a conclusion. 1. By refusing to fight he would escape the sin of slaying the family with all its evil effects, and thus retain the former good that he has already done. 2. He would escape the sin of killing his own kinsmen. 3. His relatives, friends and teachers would live. 4. To spare the lives of relations and teachers is in itself a good act which ultimately would help him to rise higher and higher in spirituality.",

    "translation": "Sanjaya said: Arjuna, having spoken thus on the battlefield, cast aside his bow and arrow and sank down on his chariot-seat, his mind overcome with grief.",
    "commentary": "With the mind distressed by sorrow:Arjuna dropped the great bow Gandiva and sat down in a mood of doubt, despair and helplessness. Never before in his life did he do so on any battle-field in any situation. So there should be a powerful cause for the present problem of Arjuna. This cause is easily discernable from his own words. It is nothing but the deeply planted feeling of attachment for his relations and friends, and the awful contemplation of slaying them in the battle. He speaks repeatedly of ‘svajanam‘ (our people). His distress for the destruction of his own people touches his very heart and throws the whole man off his balance. As a result, he decides to give up every thing-kingdom, pleasures, and enjoyments, even dominion over the three worlds. Lord Krishna seizes this opportune moment when Arjuna’s mind was filled with the thought of absolute renunciation and teaches the highest Brahmavidya. Hence Arjuna’s despondency is transformed into a Yoga.",
