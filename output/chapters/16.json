    "translation": "Having fallen into the wombs of the demons and being deluded from birth to birth, they never attain Me, Ο son of Kunti, but go farther down to the lowest state.",
    "commentary": "The Lord describes the progress of these wicked men after they are hurled into demonical wombs. They do not attain Him because they are deluded. So they go down into lower and lower states of existence. They are born as cruel beasts and then as reptiles and then again as beasts and poisonous trees and so on. That is their fate. As the rubber ball dropped on the top of the stair-case rolls down step by step, these evil souls go down into lower and lower conditions. Hearing this exhortation of the Lord, and the graphic description of the fate of evil doers, who would not wake up to the realities of life and action? Who would not turn away from evil? Who would not surrender to the Lord? Who would not pray to Him to be saved? We can understand why the Lord presents the fate of evil-doers so picturesquely, so intensely and with such terrific force. He warns mankind, a terrible warning it is indeed which only the most abandoned souls could fail to understand. Let mankind wake up to truth, and know where they are, what they are, and what their fate would be. Let them not go down into hell, but lift themselves up by devotion to the Lord, and by the steady cultivation of the Divine qualities.",

    "commentary": "The wise value the good qualities described as Daivisampat and try to cultivate them in their life. Opposed to this, men of demonical nature embrace the wicked qualities mentioned in this verse. That is why they are spoken of asAsurasamapat. Really speaking, the demonical state is not sampat (treasure) at all. And yet people are so deluded that they hug these wicked qualities and think of themselves as great men. The Lord mentions six qualities of the demonical nature. They are elaborately discussed in this discourse. In the great war with Maya, it is necessary to know and understand the power of the enemy forces as well as the forces of one’s own. Only then it would be possible to wage successful war with the enemy. If anybody wants to live in a house, he should first of all clean it of the dust, cobwebs and other foul things, and then light some scented sticks to purify the atmosphere. So also, man should keep the body pure, the foul things in it should be ejected and nourishing food should be taken in. In the same manner, purity of mind should be cultivated by abandoning the bad qualities which have been possessing the heart for a long time in one’s ignorant state. The removal of vicious taints from nature and the formation of healthy patterns of character and conduct, is the duty of all men.",

    "translation": "The divine treasures are said to be for the purpose of liberation, and the heritage of the demons, for bondage. Grieve not, Ο Pāndava; you are born with divine treasures.",
    "commentary": "Having described the divine and demonical nature, the Lord now declares the fruits of each. When a man knows the effects of the things, he is induced to accept things, which yield good results and abandon others which yield bad results. Divine nature leads to liberation, the demonical leads to bondage. The two natures function in opposite directions and yield opposite results. One liberates and the other binds, enslaves. The thoughtful know what to choose, between freedom and slavery. No one wants pain and suffering, ignorance and darkness, slavery and bondage. Therefore it is our duty to dispel darkness with light, to remove ignorance with knowledge, and to crush demonical nature with divine.",

The Aryans and non-Aryans are divided distinctly by the qualities, which they exhibit. All other distinctions of races and creeds are subsequent divisions brought about by men, by geographical and other external considerations.

    "commentary": "The worldly man finds no end to his desires, wants, and enjoyments. They can end only with the man’s death, or the dissolution of the world. Let us understand clearly that desires do not end themselves at any time. They should be cut by the sword of discrimination and burnt in the fire of Jnana. Otherwise, they continue forever. Being ignorant and deluded by Maya, they think and decide that there is nothing more than sensual enjoyment in the world, there is no such thing as Dharma or Moksha, and Artha and Kama alone exist for man. They see nothing beyond the body and the senses and so they conclude that sense-enjoyments, and bodily pleasures, are the only things to be sought in the world. They are enslaved by innumerable desires. And so they have no rest or peace of mind. The desires clamour for satisfaction, and to satisfy the desires, they should have wealth. To secure the means of enjoyment they follow unrighteous means; By treachery, falsehoods etc., they get wealth and spend it on securing physical enjoyments. Thus they live a life of kama (lust) and krodha (anger), for, where there is kama, kordha follows as its closest associate.",

    "transliteration": "āsurīṁ yonim āpannā mūḍhā janmani janmanimām aprāpyaiva kaunteya tato yānty adhamāṁ gatim",
    "word_by_word_meaning": "āsurīm—demoniac; yonim—wombs; āpannāḥ—gaining; mūḍhāḥ—the ignorant; janmani janmani—in birth after birth; mām—me; aprāpya—failing to reach; eva—even; kaunteya—Arjun, the son of Kunti; tataḥ—thereafter; yānti—go; adhamām—abominable; gatim—destination",
    "translation": "Having fallen into the wombs of the demons and being deluded from birth to birth, they never attain Me, Ο son of Kunti, but go farther down to the lowest state.",
    "commentary": "The Lord describes the progress of these wicked men after they are hurled into demonical wombs. They do not attain Him because they are deluded. So they go down into lower and lower states of existence. They are born as cruel beasts and then as reptiles and then again as beasts and poisonous trees and so on. That is their fate. As the rubber ball dropped on the top of the stair-case rolls down step by step, these evil souls go down into lower and lower conditions. Hearing this exhortation of the Lord, and the graphic description of the fate of evil doers, who would not wake up to the realities of life and action? Who would not turn away from evil? Who would not surrender to the Lord? Who would not pray to Him to be saved? We can understand why the Lord presents the fate of evil-doers so picturesquely, so intensely and with such terrific force. He warns mankind, a terrible warning it is indeed which only the most abandoned souls could fail to understand. Let mankind wake up to truth, and know where they are, what they are, and what their fate would be. Let them not go down into hell, but lift themselves up by devotion to the Lord, and by the steady cultivation of the Divine qualities.",

    "transliteration": "tri-vidhaṁ narakasyedaṁ dvāraṁ nāśhanam ātmanaḥkāmaḥ krodhas tathā lobhas tasmād etat trayaṁ tyajet",
    "word_by_word_meaning": "tri-vidham—three types of; narakasya—to the hell; idam—this; dvāram—gates; nāśhanam—destruction; ātmanaḥ—self; kāmaḥ—lust; krodhaḥ—anger; tathā—and; lobhaḥ—greed; tasmāt—therefore; etat—these; trayam—three; tyajet—should abandon",
    "translation": "Three are the gateways of this hell leading to the ruin of the self— lust, wrath, and greed. Therefore let man renounce these three.",
    "commentary": "The Lord reiterates what has been said already. Kama, krodha, and lobha form the triple opening into Hell. They are the three evils (Dushtatrayam) which directly lead man into the lower worlds. When these gates are shut by dispassion, love and detachment, there is no fear for man. The demonical qualities so elaborately described so far, are epitomised and classified into three essential evils 1. Desire, 2. Wrath, 3. Greed. Desire is to be conquered by dispassion, wrath by love, greed by discrimination and detachment. There is hope for the awakened souls who have become conscious of the evils in them, and the horrible future that awaits them if they do not destroy these evils. Striving for purity and the higher way of life they shall shut down the gateway to Hell. These evils lurking in the heart like thieves in darkness should be detected by the torch-light of knowledge and should be driven out with the help of the Divine qualities.",

    "translation": "The man who has escaped these three gates of darkness, Ο son of Kunti, practises what is good for himself and thus attains the Supreme Goal.",
    "commentary": "So long as the triple evil of desire, anger, and greed poison the heart of man, he cannot do any good. He cannot accomplish his own well-being. Therefore man should first purify his heart by reducing and eliminating these corrosive evils. Then he spontaneously rises to higher planes of spiritual life and attains Moksha. Like the sun and moon freed from the darkening grip of Rahu and Ketu, like the Gajendra freed from the death hold of the crocodile (Makara), like the prisoner brought out into the sunlight from the darkness of the prison-cell, the Jiva should liberate himself from the strange-hold of those three evils. He should become vimuktah (i.e) completely free from them. The idea is that there should not be any trace of these evils anywhere in the mind. They are the gateways of darkness (i.e) they are forms of ignorance (avidya) where there is no gleam of light, where everything is plunged in darkness. Such a man is like one living in a closed house full of darkness. He lives in sorrow and perishes in sorrow.",

    "translation": "He who discards the injunctions of the scriptures and acts upon the impulse of desire attains neither perfection nor happiness nor the Supreme Goal.",
    "commentary": "Indisciplined conduct under the impulse of one’s own desires and passions is condemned here. We come across people who act in their own way and try to make a philosophy out of it. This is wrong. It is only a mask to cover up their own unbridled passions and evil desires. They deny the authority of the Sastras, because they are deluded by ignorance and agitated by sensual desires. The Sastras embody the laws of life both secular and spiritual, which have been discovered after long research into the meaning and purpose of human life by the greatest of men, the Rishis, whose only aim was the welfare of humanity. They stated the laws following which man attains the best things in secular life and the highest goal in spiritual life. So, every true seeker should test his way of life, his thoughts, feelings and actions by referring them to the scriptural laws. Where they do not conform to the Sastras, they should be checked and restrained, and right methods should be adopted. The Lord declares that no good can be achieved by acting contrary to the commands of the Sastras, because the Sastras express the will of God. So, the seekers should carefully study the Sastras and mould their life accordingly, so that they can secure both worldly happiness and spiritual realisation.",

    "translation": "Therefore let the scriptures be your authority in determining what ought to be done and what ought not to be done. Having learnt the injunctions of the scriptures, you should do your work in the world.",
    "commentary": "What ought to be done or what ought not to be done in any particular situation? The decision is by the Sastras and not by individual opinion. The Scripture is the authority. As it is declared in the previousverse, man can achieve all the good things of life, happiness and moksha also, if he acts strictly according to the scriptural injunctions. Action contrary to them leads to unhappiness, frustration, and death. One can understand how the Lord values the Vedas and the Sastras, when He, Paramatma Himself declares them to be the highest authority. Let everybody then put his faith in the Sastras, and model his life in harmony with their laws. This is enough. That will lead him to the goal.",
