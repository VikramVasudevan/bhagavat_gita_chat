    "commentary": [
      "Arjuna says that his delusion is gone by hearing the divine exposition of the Highest, by the Lord Himself. Arjuna was thinking, “These are my relations; how can I kill them?” This kind of body identification is gone. The Gita-teaching continues. But the fundamental Truth of the immortality of the Self has already been declared. And the all-pervading universality of the Lord has also been declared in definite terms. Arjuna is lifted out of the mire of delusion and despondency.",
      "He speaks of the Lord’s teaching as ‘Paramam‘ the highest and the best, and as ‘Guhyam‘ the greatest secret, knowing which all delusion ceases.",
      "The speaker is Lord Krishna and the hearer is Arjuna. What wonder that the Lord’s medicine works on his deluded patient and cures him even before the course of treatment is completed! The effect of the Lord’s teaching is immediately felt by the disciple. Most of the people are in the same position as Arjuna, deluded and beset with doubts. If they adopt the same attitude as Arjuna-“Sishyaste ham sādhi mām tvām prapannam“-there is absolutely no doubt that the Lord works on them with the same affection and compassion as he did in the case of Arjuna. What is needed is faith in the Lord. Arjuna had that faith, and so he declared that the teaching was given to him (madanugrahāya) by the compassion of the Guru towards his disciple. Those who have faith hope to have the same revelation as Arjuna had by the grace of the Lord. Krishna Paramatma is Jagadguru, and the Gita is the teaching for all mankind. Whoever believes himself to be a true disciple receives the teaching directly from Krishna Himself. Therefore let all people win the Lord’s grace by total and un-conditional self-surrender to Him.",

      "What we know here is the humility of Arjuna in appealing to the Lord to show His Cosmic Form, if it is possible for him to see it. Is he fit for it? Is he fit for seeing the vision? He did not demand it as a right, in the manner of a person who claims it as a reward of his devotion. Such humility is needed for every disciple in the presence of the Guru. He should leave it to the teacher to give him any experience which he thinks fit for the disciple. The disciple does not know what he is, what his powers are, and what he is fit for. The teacher knows it. So Arjuna appeals to the Lord to show him the Cosmic Form if the Lord thinks that he is fit to see it. Moreover, in the previousverse, Arjuna has declared his complete faith in the words of the Lord. He believes every word of the Lord when He described His infinite Glory. So faith and humility are the only means to win the Lord’s Grace."

      "In theVibhuti Yoga, the Lord declared that the whole universe exists as a fragment of His Glory (ekamsena sthito jagat). So here, the Lord asks Arjuna to behold the whole universe standing like one of the limbs in the body. One can only imagine the infinity of the Lord. Nay, it is beyond all imagination, to whatever extent it may be stretched by human effort. Physical space is indeed unimaginably large; larger should be the mindspace; larger still should be ‘Chidākāśa’. In this infinity (Atma) the whole universe (Jagat) is like a spot.",
      "The Lord of infinite forms, all-pervading, all-powerful, is no other than Paramatma who is the ruler of all the worlds (Sarva loka mahesvaram). Knowing Him as such, it is man’s duty to worship Him with faith, devotion, and humility. Verily, there is no cause for man to feel proud of his little wealth or power or position. What are man’s wealth and powers? What is man after all in the scheme of this universe? What after all is this earth where man glorifies himself by building a small state or empire? Man’s egoism and pride for his so-called achievements is sheer delusion (Avidya). What is small appears great; what is not appears to be the reality; what is death-struck appears immortal. This ignorance, the mother of pride and arrogance, will vanish as man truly contemplates the might of Isvara and His infinite Glory. Let the seeker be filled with adoration to the Lord, infinite and wonderful. Let his humility purify his heart. Let egotism vanish into nothing and then the Lord comes to dwell in the heart of the meek and the humble. Then comes true devotion (Para bhakti)."

    "commentary": [
      "The eye of flesh can only see material things. Even physical ether is invisible to the naked eye. The limitations of the human eye and the gross delusions to which it is subject every moment, it within the experience of every thoughtful man. That the human eye is grossly erroneous in its perceptions can be seen from very simple facts. Sitting in the railway carriage, the eye sees the objects around moving with terrific speed. It sees the stationery sun crossing the sky from east to west. It sees the moon running behind the rushing clouds. All these show that the naked eye cannot be trusted to give us a correct picture of anything in the world. In fact, the eye is the most powerful cause of delusion for man. So, the Lord here says that Arjuna cannot see the Cosmic-Form by himself with his own eyes.",
      "“Drisyate tvagraya buddhya sukshamaya sukshmadarsibhih.” Paramatma is seen by the subtle concentrated intellect of the Seers. So say the Upanishads. Though the Lord is everywhere, man is not able to see Him because ignorance covers the eye. This is the evil of Māyā; this is the darkness or ignorance. When the covering film is taken away, the eye of knowledge sees the Truth, and delusion vanishes.",
      "As the blind man cannot see the sun, so also the eye of the ignorant cannot see the all-pervading Self. It is utter nonsense to say that God does not exist because He is not seen by the eye of flesh. The argument would be as convincing as the blind man’s denial of the existence of the sun.",
      "How then can man attain the divine eye to see the Lord? Assuredly, by the grace of the Lord, by His love, by His compassion. “Dadami te chakshuh“, says the Lord (I give to you the divine eye). To whom does he give the divine eye? To those who are devoted to Him. (Tesham satatayuktanam dadami buddhiyogam 10.10). The same idea is emphasised here. Repeatedly does the Lord inculcate the idea of surrender to Him in a spirit of devotion and humility. “Worship Me,” He says, “in every possible way; take refuge in Me; surrender to Me; I will give you knowledge, peace and bliss”. Arjuna had surrendered to the Lord, and so he has qualified himself to see the Cosmic-From, and the Lord bestows on him the divine eye for that purpose.",
      "The divine eye comes to all without distinction of caste, creed, religion, or nationality. If it does not open, it is one’s own fault. “Knock and it shall be opened.” The knocking must be there. Relentless perseverance is needed. Such spiritual thirst for the Divine bears fruition in the Lord’s grace descending on man. Let everyone follow the footsteps of Arjuna and obtain the Lord’s grace.",
      "M:“When one sees God does one see Him with these eyes?”Sri Ramakrishna:“God cannot be seen with these physical eyes.In the course of spiritual discipline one gets a ‘love body’, endowed with ‘love eves’, ‘love ears’, and so on. One sees God with those ‘love eyes’. One hears the voice of God with those ‘love ears’. One even gets a sexual organ made of love.”At these words M. burst out laughing.

      "As the light of thousand stars, twinkling together in the sky, cannot be compared with the light of the moon, and as the light of a thousand moons, cannot be compared with the light of the sun, similarly, the splendour of a thousand stars shining all at once, in the sky, cannot be like that of the cosmic form, of the Lord. It means that the splendour of the Lord was incomparable.The reason is that the effulgence of the sun is material, while the splendour of the Lord was divine.So, the splendour belonging to two different categories, cannot he compare, only an indication can be given. Therefore, by referring to the brilliance of a thousand suns. Sañjaya is, hinting at the effulgence of the cosmic form.",
      "The light (splendour) of a thousand suns shining all at once in the sky, can’t match the radiance of the Lord because the radiance present in the sun has also emanated from God (BG 15.12).

Why, then, weren’t the courtiers burnt up?It was because the brilliance of Rama was not like that of a material object.As the lotus blooms when the sun rises, so the lotus of the heart of the people assembled in the court burst into blossom.”",
      "“Can everyone comprehend Brahman, the Indivisible Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute?He alone has attained perfect love of God who, having reached the Absolute, keeps himself in the realm of the Relative in order to enjoy the divine lila.A man can describe the ways and activities of the Queen (Queen Victoria.) if he has previously visited her in England. Only then will his description of the Queen be correct. Sages like Bharadvaja adored Rama and said: ‘O Rama, You are nothing but the Indivisible Satchidananda. You have appeared before us as a human being, but You look like a man because You have shrouded Yourself with Your own maya.’ These rishis were great devotees of Rama and had supreme love for God.”(Source:Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna)",
      "The luminosity of Ātman consists in the manifestation of all objects. Its luminosity is not (*) like that of fire or any such thing, for (in spite of the presence of such lights) darkness prevails at night (at some place or other). — Aparokshanubhuti, Verse 22",
      "[*] Its luminosity is not, etc.—The light of Ātman is unlike any other light. Ordinary lights are opposed to darkness and are limited in their capacity to illumine things. It is a common experience that where there is darkness there is no light; and darkness always prevails at some place or the other, thus limiting the power of illumination of such lights. Even the light of the sun is unable to dispel darkness at some places. But the light of Ātman is ever present at all places.It illumines everything and is opposed to nothing, not even to darkness; for it is in and through the light of Ātman, which is present in everybody as consciousness, that one comprehends darkness as well as light and all other things.",
      "He came to tell about the light. This was the real light, the light that comes into the world and sustains everything (JOHN 1.09). O Lord, not even a million suns could match You (RV 8.70.05). Robert Oppenheimer spoke this verse as he witnessed the explosion of the first atom bomb."

      "As M. was walking in the temple garden, he suddenly came upon the Master talking to Narendra on the bank of the goose-pond. Sri Ramakrishna said to Narendra:“Look here. Come a little more often. You are a new-comer. On first, acquaintance people visit each other quite often, as is the case with a lover and his sweetheart. (Narendra and M. laugh.) So please come, won’t you?”Narendra, a member of the Brahmo Samaj, was very particular about his promises. He said with a smile, “Yes, sir, I shall try.”",
      "As they were returning to the Master’s room, Sri Ramakrishna said to M.:“When peasants go to market to buy bullocks for their ploughs, they can easily tell the good from the bad by touching their tails. On being touched there, some meekly lie down on the ground. The peasants recognize that these are without mettle and so reject them. They select only those bullocks that frisk about and show spirit when their tails are touched. Narendra is like a bullock of this latter class. He is full of spirit within.”",
      "The Master smiled as he said this, and continued: “There are some people who have no grit whatever. They are like flattened rice soaked in milk — soft and mushy. No inner strength!”",
      "…… M. had been enchanted by the Master’s sweet music. With some hesitation he asked him whether there would be any more singing that evening. “No, not tonight”, said Sri Ramakrishna after a little reflection. Then, as if remembering something, he added: “But I’m going soon to Balaram Bose’s house in Calcutta. Come there and you’ll hear me sing.” M. agreed to go.MASTER:“Do you know Balaram Bose?”M:“No, sir. I don’t.”MASTER:“He lives in Bosepara.”M:“Well, sir, I shall find him.”As Sri Ramakrishna walked up and down the hall with M., he said to him: “Let me ask you something. What do you think of me?”M. remained silent. Again Sri Ramakrishna asked: “What do you think of me? How many annas of knowledge of God have I?”M: “I don’t understand what you mean by ‘annas’. But of this I am sure:I have never before seen such knowledge, ecstatic love, faith in God, renunciation, and catholicity anywhere.“The Master laughed.M. bowed low before him and took his leave. He had gone as far as the main gate of the temple garden when he suddenly remembered something and came back to Sri Ramakrishna, who was still in the natmandir. In the dim light the Master, all alone, was pacing the hall, rejoicing in the Self — as the lion lives and roams alone in the forest.In silent wonder M. surveyed that great soul."

      "In Paramātmā who is Time, there is no division of past, present and future. Therefore Arjuna sees in the Cosmic-Form the whole vision of the future. He finds the Kauravas, the Kings, Bhishma, Drona Karna, and also the warrior-chiefs on his own side, hurrying into the horrid mouth of the Lord. What does this mean? All beings come out of the Lord and go back into Him. All time is one universal present for the Lord. He is Time, He is beyond Time. The idea of the division of Time is created in Him.",
      "The vision of Arjuna should be a revelation to every human being. All that appears to exist in the various shapes and forms as wife, children, wealth and possessions, Kingdoms and powers, are crushed to death under the mighty chariot wheel of Time. Nothing remains of the fond illusions which the little mind of man is dreaming of in this world. Knowing this, who will cling to them desperately? He knows that they will pass off like summer clouds. Then will arise true dispassion they will pass off like summer (Vairagya), when man frees himself from the thousand bonds of earthly attachments and connections.",
      "To see the future in the present is Knowledge. The Jiva visualises death and the dissolution of the body in the present moment itself. He is then free from attachment, free from fear, free from the dualities of pleasure and pain etc. He realises that the Lord alone is the Immortal Reality. Thus he becomes a true devotee and yearns for immortality and the realisation of Truth.",
      "Therefore let all aspirants see and understand the vision of Arjuna, and become truly dispassionate amidst the wonderful delusions of earthly life."

      "The Lord now reveals to him that he is not the slayer, but that the Lord in the Cosmic Form of Time, has already destroyed them, and that Arjuna is to be merely an instrument. It is the greatest secret to know that man is not really the doer. The sense of doership is the cause of bondage (ahamkaravimudhātma kartāhamiti manyate 3-27). It is the Lord with His inscrutable power of Maya, that does everything. Knowing this the wise man is not deluded.

After conquering thy enemies, enjoy unrivalled dominion; verily, by Myself have they been already slain; be thou merely the instrument, O Savyasachin (Arjuna).” In these and similar passages in the Gita the Lord is showing the way to dharma.[Source])",

    "commentary": [
      "Ma vyadhisthah:“Do not fear”. This again is the Mahamantra of the Gita, – a single word into which the essence of the Gita is distilled.Fearlessness, courage, spirit of action, these are taught in the Gita as the main doctrines of life.Having surrendered everything to the Lord, having understood that He is the real actor in this wonderful drama of life, why should man fear, when he is working as a mere instrument in the hands of God? Self-surrender and righteous action cannot have the seeds of fear in them. Therefore the Lord exhorts Arjuna to carry out his duty without any fear. In daily life, man is caught in fearful circumstances, and confronted with formidable obstacles. Everyone knows this. In such moments, if the Lord’s exhortation is remembered, man is inspired with a higher power which will enable him to overcome all the obstacles in the way. No one should give up his duty out of fear. “Yudhyasva” (fight) that is what the Lord wants everyone to do, according to his status in life. The duties of life are prescribed for all, and each man has to perform them without fear or cowardice. The word ‘jetasi‘ (you shall conquer) declares victory as the fruit of action. Thus, if a man surrenders himself to the Lord, and fights the battle of life righteously, he is sure to obtain victory. Where Sri Krishna is, there is victory.",
      "Though Bhishma and others are still alive, the Lord declares them to be ‘already dead’ (hatah). What does this mean? In the26th and 27th verses, the secret has been revealed. The Lord is Time, not time as we see it divided into past, present and future, but Eternity in which there cannot be any of these divisions manufactured by the limited mind of man. The past, present and future are one in Eternal Time. So the future of man is easily foreseeable by the divine vision. So the enemy warriors are dead already, killed by the Lord, in the Cosmic aspect of Time. Man should learn a great lesson from this. He will find that what he is considering worthy and pleasant, all the relations and friends, all the treasures and loves and hatreds, are already dead and gone, though appearing to live. Death then loses its power over the wise man who regards everything as entering the blazing mouths of the Cosmic Form. The worlds are also dead and gone. Why then this clinging to a little bit of flesh? Why then weep and wail for the loss of this or that? Time takes away all. Nay, it is all taken away already. Thus knowing, the wise man is not deluded. Renunciation (Vairagya) comes to him spontaneously. Lord Buddha thought of this inevitable sequence of human life, and was inspired to find out that, which does not die in the midst of death? That question comes to all at one time or other. The answer also comes in due course. The Self of man is man beyond death. Realising the Self-Atma, man is freed from the shadow of death. He acquires immortality in the world."

Or, Sat may be taken to mean ‘mind’ and Asat the ‘body’. Thus taken also, we get the same idea. From the standpoint of Paramatma, both the physical and mental worlds do not exist. Paramatma alone is.

      "The Lord’s power is Infinite! Who can measure Him? If we can use our eyes and look around day or night, we can get a faint glimpse of the infinite extension of the Lord’s power. The man of science is discovering infinitesimal fragments of His Divine power. The more powerful telescopes reveal more and more of the immeasurable star-worlds on all sides. The more powerful microscopes reveal infinitesimally smaller and smaller beings everywhere. So the Lord is greater than the greatest, larger than the largest, smaller than the smallest. What is man before the Divine! Man’s attempt to know God’s power is just like an ant’s attempt to fathom the depth of the ocean!",

Man can dig a well for water, God can plunge the world in a deluge, making miles around vast sheets of water! Man can shoot a rocket into space! God can shoot stars and planets into space. What is man’s power before God’s! The rational man knows that he is nothing before God. His ego vanishes that very moment, and he prostrates himself before God, as Arjuna did in this situation. It is only the blind, little-minded, deluded men who boast of their power and position. Man grows and evolves, as his eyes are cleared of the cataract. He realises gradually the Infinity in which he is placed – Infinity before and behind; Infinity in the past and future; Infinity everywhere! The little human being discovers the Infinite, he becomes the Infinite; contemplating the Divine, he becomes the Divine, Delusion vanishes, Man realises the Self.",

We laugh at the silly little thing, knowing that its glamour is only for a second, that it will break and dissolve in the ocean.

Ramakrishna was glad to see Narendra and asked him to sit on the corner of his bed. After a few minutes the Master drew near him in an ecstatic mood, muttered some words, fixed his eyes on him, and placed his right foot on Narendra’s body. At his touch Narendra saw, with open eyes, the whole world vanishing — the walls, the room, the temple garden, and even himself were disappearing into the void. He felt sure that he was facing death. He cried out loudly:“Ah, what are you doing to me? Don’t you know that I have parents at home?”Listening to this, the Master laughed and then touching Narendra’s chest, said:“All right, let it stop now. It will happen in its own good time.”With this Narendra became normal again. (Source: God Lived With Them)",

      "A few days later, while at his home in Calcutta, Mathur experienced bhava samadhi (a state in which the mind is between the absolute plane and the relative plane). Sri Ramakrishna described what happened next: “He sent for me; and when I went there I found him altogether changed — he wasn’t the same man.Whenever he spoke of God, he shed floods of tears. His eyes were red from weeping, and his heart was pounding.When he saw me, he fell down and clasped my feet. ‘Father,’ he said, ‘I admit it — I’m beaten! I’ve been in this state for the past three days. I can’t apply my mind to worldly affairs, however hard I try. Everything is going wrong. Please take back the ecstasy you gave me. I don’t want it.’‘But you begged me for ecstasy,’I said.‘I know I did. And it is indeed a blissful state — but what’s the use of bliss when all my worldly affairs are going to pieces? This ecstasy of yours, Father, it only suits you. The rest of us don’t really want it. Please take it back!’Then I laughed and just rubbed Mathur’s chest with my hand and he was himsel again.” (Source: They Lived with God)",
      "Some devotees would tell Sri Ramakrishna about their spiritual experiences. Hearing them,Swami Brahmanandaasked the Master to grant him some spiritual experiences.

      "A couple of days later, in the evening, Swami Brahmananda saw the Master walking towards the Divine Mother’s temple, and he followed him. Sri Ramakrishna entered the temple, but the disciple did not dare go inside, so he sat in the natmandir [the hall in front of the temple] and began to meditate. After a while he suddenly saw a brilliant light, like that of a million suns, rushing towards him from the shrine of the Divine Mother. He was frightened and ran to the Master’s room.",
      "A little later Sri Ramakrishna returned from the shrine. When he saw Swami Brahmananda in his room, he said: “Hello! Did you sit for meditation this evening?”",
      "“Yes, I did,” answered Swami Brahmananda, and he told the Master what had happened.",

      "Vaikuntha was present when the events of 1 January took place. After the Master had blessed two or three devotees with his powerful divine touch, Vaikuntha went before him, reverently bowed down to him, and implored, “Sir, please bestow your grace on me.” The Master answered, “You’ve achieved everything.” Vaikuntha said: “Sir, when you say that I’ve achieved everything, it must be so. Kindly help me so that I can understand it a little.” The Master said, “All right,” and gently touched his chest for a moment. Vaikuntha described it thus: “Consequently, a wonderful change came across my mind. I began to see the Master’s gracious, smiling, and luminous form in the sky, the houses, the trees, all human beings, and in everything else I saw in all directions. I was overwhelmed with extreme bliss. At that time I saw you both [the author and Latu] on the roof and called to you loudly: ‘O you all! Wherever you are, come here right now.’ That spiritual mood and vision continued for some days, even in the waking state. I was amazed and spellbound by seeing the blessed Master in all things. This experience remained whether I went to the office or elsewhere on business.",
      "“My work suffered because I couldn’t concentrate on my regular duties. When I realized this, I tried unsuccessfully to stop that vision for a while.I now understood a little why Arjuna was afraid when he had the vision of the cosmic form of Lord Krishna and why he prayed to Krishna to withdraw it. I remembered that the scriptures said liberated souls dwelt in the same exalted state of consciousness. I now got a little glimpse from this experience of how much desirelessness is necessary for a person to remain continuously in that state.Hardly had a few days passed when I was overwhelmed by this continuous vision and spiritual mood, and found it difficult to function. Sometimes I thought: ‘Shall I lose my mind?’ At last I prayed to the Master fearfully: ‘O Lord, I’m not able to contain this spiritual fervour. Please release me from this state.’ Woe to human weakness and stupidity! Now I think: ‘Why did I pray that way? Why didn’t I have faith in him and wait patiently to see what the ultimate result would be? I might have become mad, or my body might have dropped away.’ Soon after that prayer, my vision and spiritual mood abruptly came to an end. I was fully convinced that my experience came to an end by the same person from whom I had received it. But perhaps because the complete cessation of that vision didn’t arise in my mind as I prayed, he kindly kept a little of that experience in me: I could see that divine, effulgent, gracious form of the Master several times a day and was overwhelmed with joy and blessedness.” (Source: Sri Ramakrishna and His Divine Play)",

A meeting was arranged in the paved courtyard above the bathing-ghat on the Ganges, where Keshab gave a talk. He spoke very well. I went into a trance. After the lecture I said to Keshab, ‘Why do you so often say such things as:",
      "“O God, what beautiful flowers Thou hast made! O God, Thou hast created the heavens, the stars, and the ocean!” and so on?’ Those who love splendour themselves are fond of dwelling on God’s splendour.",
      "“Once a thief stole the jewels from the images in the temple of Radhakanta. Mathur Babu entered the temple and said to the Deity: ‘What a shame, O God! You couldn’t save Your own ornaments.’ ‘The idea!’ I said to Mathur. ‘Does He who has Lakshmi for His handmaid and attendant ever lack any splendour? Those jewels may be precious to you, but to God they are no better than lumps of clay. Shame on you! You shouldn’t have spoken so meanly. What riches can you give to God to magnify His glory?’",
      "“Therefore I say,a man seeks the person in whom he finds joy. What need has he to ask where that person lives, the number of his houses, gardens, relatives, and servants, or the amount of his wealth? I forget everything when I see Narendra. Never, even unwittingly, have I asked him where he lived, what his father’s profession was, or the number of his brothers.",
      "“Dive deep in the sweetness of God’s Bliss. What need have we of His infinite creation and unlimited glory?” …….",
      "Sri Ramakrishna continued:“It is also true that after the vision of God the devotee desires to witness His lila. After the destruction of Ravana at Rama’s hands, Nikasha, Ravana’s mother, began to run away for fear of her life. Lakshmana said to Rama: ‘Revered Brother, please explain this strange thing to me. This Nikasha is an old woman who has suffered a great deal from the loss of her many sons, and yet she is so afraid of losing her own life that she is taking to her heels!’ Rama bade her come near, gave her assurance of safety, and asked her why she was running away. Nikasha answered: ‘O Rama, I am able to witness all this lila of Yours because I am still alive. I want to live longer so that I may see the many more things You will do on this earth.’ (All laugh.)(To Shivanath) “I like to see you. How can I live unless I see pure-souled devotees? I feel as if they had been my friends in a former incarnation.”",
      "A BRAHMO DEVOTEE:“Sir, do you believe in the reincarnation of the soul?”MASTER:“Yes, they say there is something like that. How can we understand the ways of God through our small intellects? Many people have spoken about reincarnation; therefore I cannot disbelieve it. As Bhishma lay dying on his bed of arrows, the Pandava brothers and Krishna stood around him. They saw tears flowing from the eyes of the great hero. Arjuna said to Krishna: ‘Friend, how surprising it is! Even such a man as our grandsire Bhishma — truthful, self-restrained, supremely wise, and one of the eight Vasus — weeps, through maya, at the hour of death.’ Sri Krishna asked Bhishma about it. Bhishma replied: ‘O Krishna, You know very well that this is not the cause of my grief. I am thinking that there is no end to the Pandavas’ sufferings, though God Himself is their charioteer. (Krishna, an Incarnation of God, was Arjuna’s charioteer.) A thought like this makes me feel that I have understood nothing of the ways of God, and so I weep.'” (Source:Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna)",
      "Do you think that there is any fixed, catalogued price of so much austerity, so much japam, so much charity, etc., for God-realization? None can force realization out of Him!… But,if you don’t keep up a regular spiritual struggle, you will not be able to hold the experience when it comes.— Swami Brahmananda (Source: The Eternal Companion)",
      "You must have read what the Master used to say: ‘The breeze of divine grace is blowing all the time; it is for you to unfurl your sail.’ This unfurling of the sail means undertaking spiritual practices with sincere diligence.Through spiritual practices, one must make oneself fit to receive God’s grace.— Swami Shivananda (Source: For Seekers of God)",

      "A question arises in this verse. When Arjuna says, “tenaiva rupena chaturbhujena,” it is implied that he has seen this delightful form before? If so, when did he see this form? It appears from his imploring the Lord to forgive him for any word or act of disrespect to Him, that he has not formerly realised the Divinity of the Lord, but regarded him as a friend and relation. This contradiction can be reconciled in the following way.",
      "(1) Before the Lord revealed His Cosmic-Form, He should have shown the four-armed form of Vishnu. In the50th verse, it is said that the Lord appeared again in His normal form, (bhuyah svakam rupamdarsyamasa), and also that the Lord appeared in His gentle form (punah saumyavapur mahatma). Thus we come to know that the Lord had shown the four-armed form of Vishnu just before he assumed the Visvarupa.",
      "(2) Arjuna might have heard that when the Lord was born to Devaki, He appeared in the form of Vishnu with Discus, Conch and Crown etc.",
      "3) By seeing the Cosmic-Form, Arjuna realises that he is no other than the Supreme Lord Vishnu who rules Viakunta in His delightful form."

Once the Master told him in an ecstatic mood,“One day the gems of the Vedas and Vedanta will pour forth from your lips.”Thus Latu was commissioned and blessed by his teacher.

      "In theprevious verse, it was stated that God-realisation is not possible by Vedic study, sacrifices etc. In this verse, it is explained what makes union with God possible for man. This verse is therefore very important for all seekers. They should understand the full significance of the idea and realise it in practice.",
      "It is here declared categorically that by single-minded devotion only the Lord could be known, seen, and attained. Ananya bhakti’ is emphasised in several places in the Gita. The mind should not be attached to anything in the objective world; it should be centred in the Lord as the sole refuge, as the most beloved and as the highest goal. Devotion that is not shared, that is not tempted away from God, that does not desire anything other than God, is single-minded devotion. Man’s mind is generally possessed by worldly things and only a part of it is offered to the Lord. This is not ‘ananya bhakti’. When the mind is not distracted by anything material, it acquires divine power and thus attains the Lord.",
      "Three stages of God-realisation are mentioned here: (1) Jnatum to be known, (2) drashtum to be seen, (3) praveshtum-to be entered into. In the beginning, man acquires knowledge of the nature of the Lord. Even this is difficult, because it requires deep study and correct understanding of the Sastras. At this stage, the Lord, though his nature is understood, is quite far away. This is Dwaita. Then in the next stage, the devotee is able to see the Lord face to face, have a clear vision of God in whatever form he contemplates Him. Now there is no doubt at all about His existence, because he has directly seen the Deity. The second step is higher than the first. God is seen like a leaf or fruit in one’s own hand. This is nearly the state of Visishtadvaita.",
      "After long and arduous practice the devotee becomes united with the Lord (Praveshtum). Like salt in water, like rain drops in the ocean, like water in milk, the devotee is merged in the Lord. Then there are no two entities, the devotee and the Lord. The Lord alone is. This is the highest stage. This is perfect Advaita. The aspirant should not stop anywhere till this highest goal is reached. The first is the nearness of God (samipya), the second is the vision of the God (sarupya) and the third is union with God (sayujya). The natural progress of man towards God is explained thus in this verse. -Every aspirant should move forward from the first to the second and from the second to the last and ultimate state. It is for this reason that the Lord has stated ‘Jnatum‘ first, and ‘drashtum‘ next, and ‘Praveshtum‘ last.",
      "Suppose somebody tells us that he has seen a good and beautiful, highly relishing fruit in the market. What is our reaction? We are interested to go and see the fruit and then to buy it and eat it. At first we have come to know of the fruit (Jnatum) and next we go and see it (drashtum), and finally we are fully satisfied by tasting the fruit for ourselves (Praveshtum). The last is the state of the Jivanmukta, the liberated man. It is Moksha. We come to know of a house, see it, and then enter it. Thus one should approach God and realise Him. Everybody should attain the highest Advaitic realisation even in this very life. Then only he is free from the bondage of ‘samsara’.",
      "The Upanishad says",
      "Even the slightest separation from the Lord causes fear. When there is fear of anything, it is not perfection. So every aspirant should strive to attain the Lord (Praveshtum) and free himself from fear.",
      "If Vedic study alone could lead to God-realisation, the illiterate shall have to go without it. If austerity alone should lead to God-realisation the weak shall have no hope; If ‘yajnas’ and ‘Dana’ alone could lead to God, the poor shall have to be where they are. As it is declared by the Lord that by single-minded devotion alone he could be realised, every human being can aspire for God-realisation by pure and uncontaminated devotion. Thus out of His compassion, the Lord has revealed the easy path of God-realisation to all beings.",

      "MASTER:“Can you weep for Him with intense longing of heart? Men shed a jugful of tears for the sake of their children, for their wives, or for money. But who weeps for God?

But when the child no longer relishes the toys, it throws them aside and yells for its mother. Then the mother takes the rice-pot down from the hearth, runs in haste, and takes the child in her arms.”",

      "“Listen to a story. Once a man entered a wood and saw a small animal on a tree. He came back and told another man that he had seen a creature of a beautiful red colour on a certain tree. The second man replied: ‘When I went into the wood, I also saw that animal. But why do you call it red? It is green.’ Another man who was present contradicted them both and insisted that it was yellow. Presently others arrived and contended that it was grey, violet, blue, and so forth and so on. At last they started quarrelling among themselves. To settle the dispute they all went to the tree. They saw a man sitting under it. On being asked, he replied: ‘Yes, I live under this tree and I know the animal very well. All your descriptions are true. Sometimes it appears red, sometimes yellow, and at other times blue, violet, grey, and so forth. It is a chameleon. And sometimes it has no colour at all. Now it has a colour, and now it has none.’",
      "“In like manner, one who constantly thinks of God can know His real nature; he alone knows that God reveals Himself to seekers in various forms and aspects. God has attributes; then again He has none. Only the man who lives under the tree knows that the chameleon can appear in various colours, and he knows, further, that the animal at times has no colour at all. It is the others who suffer from the agony of futile argument.",
      "“Kabir used to say, The formless Absolute is my Father, and God with form is my Mother.’",
      "“God reveals Himself in the form which His devotee loves most. His love for the devotee knows no bounds. It is written in the Purana that God assumed the form of Rama for His heroic devotee, Hanuman.",
      "“The forms and aspects of God disappear when one discriminates in accordance with the Vedanta philosophy. The ultimate conclusion of such discrimination is that Brahman alone is real and this world of names and forms illusory.It is possible for a man to see the forms of God, or to think of Him as a Person, only so long as he is conscious that he is a devotee.From the standpoint of discrimination this ‘ego of a devotee’ keeps him a little away from God.",
      "“Do you know why images of Krishna or Kali are three and a half cubits high? Because of distance. Again, on account of distance the sun appears to be small. But if you go near it you will find the sun so big that you won’t be able to comprehend it. Why have images of Krishna and Kali a dark-blue colour? That too is on account of distance, like the water of a lake, which appears green, blue, or black from a distance. Go near, take the water in the palm of your hand, and you will find that it has no colour. The sky also appears blue from a distance. Go near and you will see that it has no colour at all.",
      "“Therefore I say that in the light of Vedantic reasoning Brahman has no attributes. The real nature of Brahman cannot be described. But so long as your individuality is real, the world also is real, and equally real are the different forms of God and the feeling that God is a Person.",
      "“Yours is the path of bhakti. That is very good; it is an easy path. Who can fully know the infinite God? and what need is there of knowing the infinite? Having attained this rare human birth, my supreme need is to develop love for the Lotus Feet of God.",
      "“If a jug of water is enough to remove my thirst, why should I measure the quantity of water in a lake? I become drunk on even half a bottle of wine — what is the use of my calculating the quantity of liquor in the tavern? What need is there of knowing the Infinite? (Source:Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna)",

    "commentary": [
      "It is clearly described how and by whom the Lord could be realised. Five essential qualities are mentioned here. Any being who could cultivate these qualities will attain the Lord without distinction of caste, creed, race or nationality. A potent medicine works on all who takes it. Anyone can light fire if oil, wick and match are secured. So is the Lord realisable by all who cultivate divine virtues.",
      "1)Matkarmakrit:This may refer to Puja, Japa, and Dhyana which are prescribed’ by the Sastras as methods of worshipping the Lord. Or, it may be taken to include all work (not evil work) which man offers to the Lord in a spirit of self-surrender. Such a man gradually develops purity of mind, acquires God’s grace, and attains Moksha. In the course of one’s daily life, he performs many actions, and all those should be surrendered to the Lord. Work then becomes worship. They are so transformed that they lead to liberation. Hence‘matkarmakrit’is mentioned as the first quality of the aspirant.",
      "2)Matparamah:The seeker should first realise that God is his sole refuge. Many people spend day and night in the pursuit of worldly objects. They are material things, perishable stuff; they cannot lead one to freedom and perfection. ‘Paramatma’ alone is real. Knowing this, the seeker considers the Lord as his refuge. He attains God.",
      "3)Madbhaktah:The man devoted to the Lord attains Him quickly. Of what avail is it to cling to mundane things which bind man and throw him into the jaws of death? Love for God is the real thing. God is the saviour. He is the Liberator. He is alone worthy of devotion and none else.",
      "4)Sangavarjitah:‘Sanga’ means attachment for the body and the objective world. Detachment should be practised. With the sword of non-attachment the mighty tree of ‘samsara’ should be cut (asanga sastrena dhridena chittva-15th Discourse). Like the water-drop on the lotus-leaf, though engaged in a hundred worldly activities, man should be detached by the very power of discrimination (Vichara). By such detachment he attains ‘Moksha’.",
      "5)Nirvairah sarvabhuteshu:The fifth quality is love for all beings, and freedom from enmity and hatred. It is not love for this or that being but love for all,-universal love. All beings are different forms of God (Narayanaswarupas). Harm done to any being is harm done to God. This truth is mentioned many times in the Gita (Adveshta sarvabhutanam etc.). Of what avail is it to read the Scripture and conduct worship of God when there is hatred and jealousy in the heart. That is not practical Vedanta. He who takes medicine should observe the rules of diet. The above-mentioned four qualities are like medicine, and this universal love, the fifth, is like diet. One’s spiritual practice should be permeated with Universal love.",
      "This verse is of very great importance in the Gita. Sri Sankaracharya declares it to be the highest truth in the Gita, the very essence of the Gita. It contains in a nut-shell all the different yogas; that which gives life to all these yogas is universal love.",
      "Therefore the seekers should contemplate this verse again and again, and acquire all the virtues needed for self-realisation even in this birth.",
      "GIRISH (to the Master):“Deben Babu has decided to renounce the world.”",
      "On account of his illness Sri Ramakrishna could hardly talk. Touching his lips with his finger, he asked Girish, by signs, “Who will feed his wife and children?”",
      "GIRISH:“I don’t know.”",
      "The other devotees remained silent. Girish began talking again while he ate the refreshments.",
      "GIRISH:“Sir, which is wiser — to renounce the world regretfully, or to call on God, leading a householder’s life?”",
      "MASTER (to M.):“Haven’t you read theGita? One truly realises God if one performs one’s worldly duties in a detached spirit, if one lives in the world after realizing that everything is illusory.",
      "“Those who regretfully renounce the world belong to an inferior class.",
      "“Do you know what a householder jnani is like? He is like a person living in a glass house. He can see both inside and outside.”",
      "Again there was silence in the room. (Source:Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna)",
      "Question:Who can attain God?",
      "Answer:He who does God’s work, who takes sole refuge in Him, who is devoted to Him, who is free from desire and attachment, and who has love for all beings, attains God.",
      "Question:What then is the path to God-realisation?",
