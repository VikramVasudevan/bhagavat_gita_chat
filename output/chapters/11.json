    "commentary": "Arjuna says that his delusion is gone by hearing the divine exposition of the Highest, by the Lord Himself. Arjuna was thinking, “These are my relations; how can I kill them?” This kind of body identification is gone. The Gita-teaching continues. But the fundamental Truth of the immortality of the Self has already been declared. And the all-pervading universality of the Lord has also been declared in definite terms. Arjuna is lifted out of the mire of delusion and despondency.",

    "commentary": "What we know here is the humility of Arjuna in appealing to the Lord to show His Cosmic Form, if it is possible for him to see it. Is he fit for it? Is he fit for seeing the vision? He did not demand it as a right, in the manner of a person who claims it as a reward of his devotion. Such humility is needed for every disciple in the presence of the Guru. He should leave it to the teacher to give him any experience which he thinks fit for the disciple. The disciple does not know what he is, what his powers are, and what he is fit for. The teacher knows it. So Arjuna appeals to the Lord to show him the Cosmic Form if the Lord thinks that he is fit to see it. Moreover, in the previousverse, Arjuna has declared his complete faith in the words of the Lord. He believes every word of the Lord when He described His infinite Glory. So faith and humility are the only means to win the Lord’s Grace.",

So here, the Lord asks Arjuna to behold the whole universe standing like one of the limbs in the body. One can only imagine the infinity of the Lord. Nay, it is beyond all imagination, to whatever extent it may be stretched by human effort. Physical space is indeed unimaginably large; larger should be the mindspace; larger still should be ‘Chidākāśa’. In this infinity (Atma) the whole universe (Jagat) is like a spot.",

    "commentary": "The eye of flesh can only see material things. Even physical ether is invisible to the naked eye. The limitations of the human eye and the gross delusions to which it is subject every moment, it within the experience of every thoughtful man. That the human eye is grossly erroneous in its perceptions can be seen from very simple facts. Sitting in the railway carriage, the eye sees the objects around moving with terrific speed. It sees the stationery sun crossing the sky from east to west. It sees the moon running behind the rushing clouds. All these show that the naked eye cannot be trusted to give us a correct picture of anything in the world. In fact, the eye is the most powerful cause of delusion for man. So, the Lord here says that Arjuna cannot see the Cosmic-Form by himself with his own eyes.",

    "commentary": "Ma vyadhisthah:“Do not fear”. This again is the Mahamantra of the Gita, – a single word into which the essence of the Gita is distilled.Fearlessness, courage, spirit of action, these are taught in the Gita as the main doctrines of life.Having surrendered everything to the Lord, having understood that He is the real actor in this wonderful drama of life, why should man fear, when he is working as a mere instrument in the hands of God? Self-surrender and righteous action cannot have the seeds of fear in them. Therefore the Lord exhorts Arjuna to carry out his duty without any fear. In daily life, man is caught in fearful circumstances, and confronted with formidable obstacles. Everyone knows this. In such moments, if the Lord’s exhortation is remembered, man is inspired with a higher power which will enable him to overcome all the obstacles in the way. No one should give up his duty out of fear. “Yudhyasva” (fight) that is what the Lord wants everyone to do, according to his status in life. The duties of life are prescribed for all, and each man has to perform them without fear or cowardice. The word ‘jetasi‘ (you shall conquer) declares victory as the fruit of action. Thus, if a man surrenders himself to the Lord, and fights the battle of life righteously, he is sure to obtain victory. Where Sri Krishna is, there is victory.",

    "commentary": "It should not be misunderstood that Vedic study, yajnas and other rites and rituals prescribed in the Sastras are all useless. Without devotion to the Lord, these acts do not yield the highest results. Austerity by itself cannot lead to God-realisation without devotion (Bhakti). Whatever may be the efforts unless the field is watered, there is no harvest. So also the works of men bear no fruit without devotion.",
