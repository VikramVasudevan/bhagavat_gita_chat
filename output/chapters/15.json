      "—–",
      "Samsara is compared to a tree. It is unlike any other tree that we see in nature. All trees have roots below and branches above. But this tree of Samsara has roots above and branches below. What is the explanation?",
      "1. From Paramatma originateAvyakta,Mahadahankara,and from them arise the whole universe along with all beings. So Paramatma is the highest source (above), and down below we find the Universe and the beings in it. So this tree is said to have its roots above (in Paramatma) and its branches below. Paramatma is the root, and the universe the branches of this tree of Samsara.",
      "2. Another explanation may be offered. The work of Maya is to show everything upside down. The impure appears pure and the pure impure; the good appears to be bad, and the bad good, the unreal appears to be real and the real unreal; pain appears to be pleasure and happiness pain. Accordingly Patanjali describes avidya thus-“anitya asuchi duhkha anatmasu ninya suchi sukhatmakhyatir avidya” A tree reflected in water appears upside down. So is the tree of Samsara reflected through Maya.",
      "3. A tree by the side of the road in its natural form is not an obstacle. But if it is turn up by the roots and falls across the road, it becomes an obstacle to the way-farers with branches down and the roots sticking up. To the pilgrims on the path of Brahmavidya, this tree of Samsara is definitely an obstacle.",
      "Asvattham: ‘svah‘ means ‘tomorrow’, and ‘na sthah‘ means ‘not existing’. So Asvattha means ‘not existing tommorow’. This tree of Samsara is of doubtful existence. No one can say whether it exists the next day or even the next hour, or even the next minute. It is perishable. It is rightly described as ‘Asvatthah’, because of its perishable and mutable character. But it is described here as ‘avyayam‘ – not perishing. How? The explanation is, here Samsara, like a flood, flows ceaselessly, birth and death occuring in an endless series for man. It continues till the moment when true knowledge is attained. It stops and disappears then. So it is in one sense imperishable and in another sense perishable. To the ignorant, it exists continuously. To the wise, it ceases to exist. So the word ‘avyayam‘ here should not be interpreted as eternal. If it is eternal, nothing can destroy it. In the third verse, the Lord instructs Arjuna to strike down the tree with the sword of Vairagya.",
      "Yas tam veda sa vedavit:He who understands the nature of Samsara, is the knower of the Vedas. The essence of the Vedas is known by him. The Vedas declare that this reflected Universe proceeds from Paramatma, who is the origin and source of all. From Him, this Universe is projected as the tree is projected from the seed. So the sage who knows this is the real knower of the Vedas.",
      "A man visited a gold shop with the intention of selling the idols of Ganesha and Mouse. He inquired about the value of the idol, and to his surprise, the shop owner quoted that the idol, regardless of whether it was of Ganesha or a mouse, would fetch the same price of ten thousand rupees for 100 grams.",
      "Perplexed, the man asked, “How can a sacred idol of Ganesha and a mere mouse have the same value?”",
      "The shop owner smiled and explained, “To you, it may seem like Ganesha and a mouse, but to me, they are simply gold.",
      "In the same way, a Brahmajnani sees all things as manifestations of the same Brahman. Yet, to the ordinary eye, the world is full of distinctions and differences.",
      "The man left the shop reflecting on this profound insight, understanding that beneath the surface of apparent diversity, the essence of all things remains unchanged.",
      "It is true that the Upanishads have this one theme before them:कस्मिन्नु भगवो विज्ञाते सर्वमिदं विज्ञातं भवति।— “What is that knowing which we know everything else?” In modern language, the theme of the Upanishads is to find an ultimate unity of things. Knowledge is nothing but finding unity in the midst of diversity. Every science is based upon this; all human knowledge is based upon the finding of unity in the midst of diversity; and if it is the task of small fragments of human knowledge, which we call our sciences, to find unity in the midst of a few different phenomena, the task becomes stupendous when the theme before us is to find unity in the midst of this marvellously diversified universe, where prevail unnumbered differences in name and form, in matter and spirit — each thought differing from every other thought, each form differing from every other form. Yet, to harmonise these many planes and unending Lokas, in the midst of this infinite variety to find unity, is the theme of the Upanishads. On the other hand, the old idea of Arundhati Nyâya applies. To show a man the fine star Arundhati, one takes the big and brilliant nearest to it, upon which he is asked to fix his eyes first, and then it becomes quite easy to direct his sight to Arundhati. This is the task before us, and to prove my idea I have simply to show you the Upanishads, and you will see it. Nearly every chapter begins with dualistic teaching, Upâsanâ. God is first taught as some one who is the Creator of this universe, its Preserver, and unto whom everything goes at last. He is one to be worshipped, the Ruler, the Guide of nature, external and internal, yet appearing as if He were outside of nature and external. One step further, and we find the same teacher teaching that this God is not outside of nature, but immanent in nature. And at last both ideas are discarded, and whatever is real is He; there is no difference. तत्त्वमसि श्वेतकेतो — “Shvetaketu, That thou art.” That Immanent One is at last declared to be the same that is in the human soul. Here is no Compromise; here is no fear of others’ opinions. Truth, bold truth, has been taught in bold language, and we need not fear to preach the truth in the same bold language today, and, by the grace of God, I hope at least to be one who dares to be that bold preacher.[Source]",
      "—–",
      "Science is nothing but the finding of unity. As soon as science would reach perfect unity, it would stop from further progress, because it would reach the goal. Thus Chemistry could not progress farther when it would discover one element out of which all other could be made. Physics would stop when it would be able to fulfill its services in discovering one energy of which all others are but manifestations, and the science of religion become perfect when it would discover Him who is the one life in a universe of death, Him who is the constant basis of an ever-changing world. One who is the only Soul of which all souls are but delusive manifestations. Thus is it, through multiplicity and duality, that the ultimate unity is reached. Religion can go no farther. This is the goal of all science.",
      "All science is bound to come to this conclusion in the long run. Manifestation, and not creation, is the word of science today, and the Hindu is only glad that what he has been cherishing in his bosom for ages is going to be taught in more forcible language, and with further light from the latest conclusions of science.[Source]",

      "Answer:It has its roots above and branches down. It is imperishable till ‘jnana’ is attained. The ‘Vedas’ are its leaves.",

    ],
    "commentary": [
      "The tree of samsara is vividly described here. It is not a small tree. It has grown strong and firm from millions of births, and has deeply established its roots in the world. Its branches spread upto Brahma loka. Its roots are the past samskaras of action. The three Gunas are its branches. Its tender shoots grow by enjoyment of sense-objects. How then to cut this mighty tree? The branches should be struck by purifying the mind of the three Gunas; the tender shoots should be cut by dispassion towards sense-enjoyments; and the roots should be destroyed by removing the past tendencies of the mind. As all trees are sustained by their roots, this tree of samsara is sustained by deeply impregnated ‘samskaras’ or ‘vasanas’, and when they are destroyed, the whole tree falls to the ground being struck at the roots. It is there that the operation should be conducted. When the roots are cut, the branches, shoots and buds wither away in a short time. The wise man therefore should cultivate dispassion (vairagya) towards sense-objects. Dispassion brings about the cessation of the impulses and urgings of action. Where there is no action, there is no bondage, resulting from Karma. If, on the other hand, man nurtures the vasanas with raga and dvesha, he can never cut the tree and gain his freedom. He will be bound to samsara almost endlessly.",
      "“I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn’t quite make out. I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn’t make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.”― Sylvia Plath, The Bell Jar",
      "Question:How is the tree of samsara further described?",
      "Answer:Its branches are nourished by the three Gunas. Sense objects are its buds. It spread upwards and downwards. Its roots are actions prompted by desires. It is firmly established in the world of men."

    ],
    "commentary": [
      "This tree of Samsara is not seen by man in the form described in the first and second verses. Why? Attached to Samsara, the ignorant do not see it as such. They do not see its beginning or end, or its present state of existence. They have not made any attempt to enquire into its real nature. They are immersed in the flood of Samsara and do not really know what it is, how it has come, and what its nature is etc. In darkness, the real nature of objects cannot be seen. Thus people live in Samsara and die in Samsara without understanding its true nature. This is Maya. Only a few awakened souls try to release themselves from its bondage, and among them only a few are able to cut the bond and attain liberation. The idea is that the darkness of ignorance is such that man is not able to realise the slavery and bondage which Samsara has imposed on him from time immemorial.",
      "This tree of Samsara is described as ‘suvirudhamulam‘ with roots deeply and firmly fixed in the world, and it has spread its branches far and wide, even upto Brahma loka. But its firmness and strength need not frighten us. Provided the weapon is sufficiently sharp and powerful, any tree can be felled to the ground. The Lord shows the weapon with which this tree can be cut. It is ‘asanga sastram’ Non-attachment to  world, and its sensual attractions and temptations is the axe which cuts the tree of Samsara. In other words, it is dispassion (vairagya). What a wonderful weapon to smash the tree of samsara! But the axe should be sharp and strong. Lukewarm and fitful vairagya (manda vairagya) is not enough. It should be blazing, burning, all-consuming ‘vairagya’. How else can this mighty tree be cut? That is why the Lord uses the word ‘dridhena’ as attribute to ‘asanga sastra’, This axe of dispassion cuts the very root of the tree and there is no more delusion or bondage. It is like destroying the main wheel of a huge factory-machine. When the main wheel is stopped, all the innumerable smaller wheels stop automatically. We need not stop every small wheel. So also, when the roots of the tree are cut, the branches, the buds and all other things wither away of their own accord. This non-attachment should be both external and internal.",
      "But the aim is yet to be realised. Vairagya eliminates the obstacles on the path of Self realisation. Having given up the ‘drisya‘, the objective world, the next step is to hold fast to the ‘Drik‘ the seer. This is important. It is not enough to clear the debts; one should acquire property, and then only he will be safe. The rejection of the sense-world is like clearing the debts. So along with ‘vairagya’ the seeker should possess jnana, knowledge of Paramatma. He should know that his real nature is Atma. Then his bliss is full and unhindered. That is why the Lord teaches That is then, the Atma is to be searched for (parimargitavyayam).",
      "This is the highest state for a human being, because, having once attained it, man does not return to samsara again (na nivartanti bhuyah). It is the law that man has to return to this world again and again whatever world he goes to by his good work until he realises Paramatma. That wise attain it and are forever at rest.",
      "The path to take for this search for the highest Truth is clearly stated here. The secret is revealed-“tam eva purusham prapadye”-“I take refuge in that Purusha alone.” This is the spirit prompting the aspirant in his search for Paramatma. It is a deeply devotional attitude, a surrender unto the Lord in the search for Atma. To him who has pure devotion, Brahma-jnana is easily attained.",
      "AshvatthaisVishvarupawhich has its root inSaguna BrahmanorAkshara. At the last stage one should have Vairagya and cut up this personal God who defies the mind to rise to higher unity as in the case of Sri Ramakrishna. This is the final obstacle in the path of spiritual life and it is here that even the highest Bhaktas like the dualistic devotees stop as they refuse to consider anything superior to this devotion. The only difference between the two Mukhya Bhakti and Para Bhakti may be noted as the realisation of unity as the highest Truth. The first shloka says that the ordinary वेदवित् rises in realization only up to the stage of knowing Akshara and worship of Akshara.",
      "The teacher and the disciple repaired to the meditation room near by. Totapuri began to impart to Sri Ramakrishna the great truths of Vedanta.",
      "“Brahman”, he said, “is the only Reality, ever pure, ever illumined, ever free, beyond the limits of time, space, and causation. Though apparently divided by names and forms through the inscrutable power of maya, that enchantress who makes the impossible possible, Brahman is really One and undivided. When a seeker merges in the beatitude of samadhi, he does not perceive time and space or name and form, the offspring of maya. Whatever is within the domain of maya is unreal. Give it up. Destroy the prison-house of name and form and rush out of it with the strength of a lion. Dive deep in search of the Self and realise It through samadhi. You will find the world of name and form vanishing into void, and the puny ego dissolving in Brahman-Consciousness. You will realise your identity with Brahman, Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute.” Quoting the Upanishad, Totapuri said: “That knowledge is shallow by which one sees or hears or knows another. What is shallow is worthless and can never give real felicity. But the Knowledge by which one does not see another or hear another or know another, which is beyond duality, is great, and through such Knowledge one attains the Infinite Bliss. How can the mind and senses grasp That which shines in the heart of all as the Eternal Subject?”",
      "Totapuri asked the disciple to withdraw his mind from all objects of the relative world, including the gods and goddesses, and to concentrate on the Absolute. But the task was not easy even for Sri Ramakrishna. He found it impossible to take his mind beyond Kali, the Divine Mother of the Universe. “After the initiation”, Sri Ramakrishna once said, describing the event, “Nangta began to teach me the various conclusions of the Advaita Vedanta and asked me to withdraw the mind completely from all objects and dive deep into the Atman. But in spite of all my attempts I could not altogether cross the realm of name and form and bring my mind to the unconditioned state. I had no difficulty in taking the mind from all the objects of the world. But the radiant and too familiar figure of the Blissful Mother, the Embodiment of the essence of Pure Consciousness, appeared before me as a living reality. Her bewitching smile prevented me from passing into the Great Beyond. Again and again I tried, but She stood in my way every time. In despair I said to Nangta: ‘It is hopeless. I cannot raise my mind to the unconditioned state and come face to face with Atman.’ He grew excited and sharply said: ‘What? You can’t do it? But you have to.’ He cast his eyes around. Finding a piece of glass he took it up and stuck it between my eyebrows. ‘Concentrate the mind on this point!’ he thundered.Then with stern determination I again sat to meditate. As soon as the gracious form of the Divine Mother appeared before me, I used my discrimination as a sword and with it clove Her in two. The last barrier fell. My spirit at once soared beyond the relative plane and I lost myself in samadhi.”",
      "Sri Ramakrishna remained completely absorbed in samadhi for three days. “Is it really true?” Totapuri cried out in astonishment. “Is it possible that he has attained in a single day what it took me forty years of strenuous practice to achieve? Great God! It is nothing short of a miracle!” With the help of Totapuri, Sri Ramakrishna’s mind finally came down to the relative plane.",
      "Cut down the banyan tree of desire with the axe of non-attachment, and it will vanish utterly.It is all illusion. “He from whom blight and delusion have fallen, he who has conquered the evils of association, he alone isāzād(free)..”[Source]",

    "commentary": [
      "In this verse, the qualities of the wise who attain the non-returning state Moksha, are clearly described. Six qualities are mentioned",
      "(1) Freedom from pride (ahamkara) and delusion,",
      "(2) Conquest of the evil of attachment to the sense-world. ‘Sanga’ is attachment; it is evil. This evil should be given up by detachment and dispassion.",
      "(3)adhyatmanityah:Dwelling constantly in the Self. Here the word ‘nitya‘ is to be noted. Constant memory and understanding are necessary. At first, the seeker spends some time in Atma nishta and then he comes out into the objective world. This period of Self-centred meditation should be extended gradually till he is firmly established in the Self always. Constancy is emphasised many times by the Lord, because ‘avidya’ overtakes man the moment when he forgets Atma. To forget Atma is itself ‘Avidya’. So, constancy is prescribed as a rule for the seekers. We come across three types of men in the world. The first and the highest are those who are constantly in contact with Self; the second are those who contemplate Atma for some time, and then go into worldly activities; and the third are those who remain immersed in worldly life always. The second type have the opportunity of rising to the highest state. The third type of people are the lowest and most miserable. They are plunged in ignorance and totally devoid of any enlightenment what-so-ever.",
      "4)Vinivrittakamah:This, the fourth quality is essential for all seekers. This is combined with ‘adhyatmanityah‘ in the same line in the verse. The two qualities are thus brought together, and they are the very essence of enlightenment. The aspirants for Moksha should repeat this line, think of it, meditate on the idea and model their life accordingly. The first istathvajnanamand the second isVasanakshyam‘. So the line ‘adhyatma nitya vinivritha kamah’ is the sum and substance of all spiritual practice. The first is the state ofdirsyarahitvam‘. The Sastras declare that both these are to be practised simultaneously. In fact, they are the two sides of the same coin (Moksha). When Drik (Atman) is attained, there is no Drisyam.",
      "(5) Freedom from the pairs of opposites, known as pleasure and pain.",
      "(6)Amudhah:Freedom from delusion. The spiritual sadhana undertaken constantly keeps away delusion, and thus the sages live in the light of perfect knowledge.",
      "What is the reward of following the above practices? People reach the immortal state of Paramatma. They leave away all other things as they are unreal, impure, sorrow-breeding, and perishable.",
      "Don’t be fools always wandering from place to place; that’s all very good, but be heroes. “Free from pride and delusion, with the evil of attachment conquered, ever dwelling in the Self, with desires completely receded, liberated from the pairs of opposites known as pleasure and pain, the undeluded reach that Goal Eternal.” Who advises you to jump into fire?

    "commentary": [
      "Mamaivamsah:The Jiva (Jivatma) in truth, is not different from Paramatma. The Jiva is directly Paramatma. Both are eternal.But the Jiva (Jivatma) being deluded by Maya, is identifying himself with the vehicle of the body and the senses and consequently suffers all the ills and pains which come to the body. The Jiva is imposing on himself all the limitations of the body and the mind. If the body is weak or sick, the Jiva says “I am sick;” if the mind is sad, the Jiva says ‘I am sad’. Thus to the body. the Jiva who in truth, is Paramatma Himself, has developed a false identification and a fictitious personality, limited by time, space and causation. This is ignorance (avidya or Maya).",
      "All the qualities of limitless ether are to be found in the ether of the pot; But the limiting form of the pot seems to limit the limitless ether. This limitation is not true. It is illusory. Ether is not bound by anything. When the pot is broken, ether remains as it is. There is no change. Thus all the blessed attributes of Paramatma are present in the Jiva (Jivatma). When the Jiva gives up this false identification and remembers his original state, he realises that He is Paramatma, and nothing other than He.",
      "When the Jiva is himself Paramatma, what are these ideas of high and low, good and bad and so on? All men are divine, all men are equal. So knowing, the wise are filled with love for all, and consider all as equal. The Lord’s declaration gives infinite strength to everyman. For, the same individual who formerly was dreaming of himself as big and small, happy and unhappy, living and dying, now is awakened to the tremendous understanding of his own true nature. Now he simply laughs at the foolish little self which he was displaying in the world on his personality. No more is there any fear of death or suffering, for he, is not the body (upadhi).",
      "Karshati:The Jiva in his ignorance draws the senses to himself with the mind. The senses are in Prakriti. The deluded Jiva draws Prakriti to himself and lives a kind of existence confined by the activities of the senses. The body is (jada) inert, and so does not claim Jiva as its own. It is the Jiva who claims the body to be his. He says “this (body) is mine”. So also he says of many things. This house is mine, this wealth is mine, this man is my father or son’ and so on. All this is gross misappropriation of things which do not really belong to him. So the word ‘Karshati’ is used by the Lord.",
      "What the jiva has to do now is to give up the false role which he has been playing on the stage of the world. He should give up calling himself Mr so and so. This Mr so and so refers to the body which the Jiva is not. He should know that this world is not his real Abode. He is Paramatma. That is his real state. With firm and unflinching determination, he should contemplate his true Self, where he would attain the highest bliss and blessedness. This false world and false self bring misery and death.",

      "As the Jiva leaves one body and takes another, like one dropping old clothes and wearing new clothes, it is clear that he is not the body at all. Therefore this body-identification (dehatma-buddhi) should be given up once and for all. ‘I am Atma’ is the Mahamantra.",
      "Moreover, the word Isvara (Lord) is used with reference to Jivatma. The Jiva in truth is the Lord of the senses, the mind, and the body and all that pertains to it. He is the master and not the slave and bondman as he is now thinking and behaving. What a fall is there – from the state of the supreme ruler to the humiliating state of a servant! This is what has happened to man. He, the ruler, has no freedom or will of his own. He has to behave according to the dictates of the mind and the senses. He has reduced himself to this wretched position, by gross ignorance. “So, give up the slavery. Awake, arise and affirm your real nature? Thou art Paramatma!” This is the trumpet call of Lord Krishna to all mankind.",
      "Grihitvaitani samyati:It is said here that the jiva when he leaves one body and obtains another, takes the mind and the senses (the vasanas) with him. He cannot take anything else with him, neither his house nor his relations and friends. They are all dropped off in the world. But what does he really take with him? He takes the mind and the five senses in the form of (vasanas), tendencies and predispositions. These determine the nature of the next birth. If these are pure, naturally the jiva is born to pure parents and enjoy a pure life. If these are impure, he is born to impure and sinful wombs, be the wombs of beasts, birds or reptiles. So one’s may future life is in his own hands. He should therefore take to spiritual sadhana even now immediately and escape from the miserable fate of being born as beasts and reptiles hereafter.",
      "These ‘vasanas’ are the only provision for the journey of the Jiva to other worlds and bodies. Nothing else can he take from here. Nothing else can be of help to him. Nothing else follows him. They cannot even if they wish to. The journey is alone and lonely. But there is no fear, for, the good that he has done and the spiritual sadhana that he has performed will be with him. The mind carries the essence of his whole life, embedded in it in subtle form. It is his body-guard in his journey. So people are themselves the makers of their future birth, good or bad or birthlessness. The last is the goal, for, it is the state of Paramatma. The wise attain it by Brahma Jnana.",
      "Vayur gandhanivasayati: This simile is used to illustrate the idea of the Jiva carrying the mind and senses with him at the time of birth and death. The wind carries all kinds of scents sweet or foul, from all kinds of objects. From flowers, sweet fragrance, from flesh, foul odour, the wind carries by absorbing the subtle essence of those objects. The wind has no likes or dislikes towards these sweet and foul scents. As the message-bearer carries good and bad news, as the wind blows sweet or foul as the case may be the jiva carries this essence of his whole life, in the subtle form of ‘vasanas’ and enters a new body. The body taken depends on the quality of the mind which the jiva is carrying. If it is impure, he goes into impure wombs, if it is pure, he enters enlightened wombs. Therefore, there is no partiality for God or the Divinities of Karma in the transmigration of the jiva. If the mind becomes so pure as to be rid of all ‘vasanas’, there is no further birth for the jiva. He attains union with Paramatma even here. So it is the primary duty of every seeker to purify the mind and the senses by constant sadhana. Thus they shall attain purer birth, and even Brahmajnana here and now.",

      "‘Why do we not see the Lord?’ – This question is asked by many. The Lord answers it.

In his very body tenanted by the jiva, who is eating, drinking sleeping, acting, enjoying and suffering, that Paramatman can be seen by right discrimination which opens the eye of knowledge (Jnanachakshushah). On account of the dominating of the objective phenomena, the deluded are not able to see Him. If he turns the mind outside, the world is reflected in it; If he turns it inside God is realised. If the mirror is turned to us, we see ourselves. If it is turned outside, the whole of the phenomenal world is seen. If the mind is turned within, kept calm, pure and firm, Atma is beheld. This Atma is seen only by such sages who can discriminate between the real and the unreal, the seer and the seen. (Seeing the Atma means, self-realisation.)",

The externalised mind which is beholding any other thing except the seer, should turn its concentrated look at the seer Himeself ‘the Lord.’ Thus the true nature of the real man within is known.

      "The Lord explains why some yogis are able to behold the Atma, whereas others fail in their efforts. The effort is common in both cases. Why should some succeed and others fail? The impure-minded people (akritatmah) do not see the Atma, in spite of their sadhana. These also do japa, dhyana and other practices, but they fail because the heart is impure, (i.e. vitiated by powerful vasanas binding them to the external world). Some people attempt to realise Atma by a Study of sastras, without eradicating the impurities of the heart. Some others carry on a show of external devotion and meditation. They do not possess real self-control, and so they fail in their search for Paramatma. We hear that the Lord insists on purity of heart as the essential condition for Atmajnana. If there is no Purity, there is no Atmajnana. When Purity is attained, Atma is realised. The path is clear.",
      "The field should be cleared of rubbish, properly tilled and watered and then the seeds grow and the harvest is gathered. Otherwise, the seeds are buried in the earth and have no chance of sprouting into life. They are wasted, for no harvest is gathered from that untilled, unwatered field (kshetram).",
      "The four elementary principles of sadhana (sadhana chatushtaya) should be cultivated first. The heart is then purified of its unholy desires, passions, and emotions. The bodily organs and the sense organs and the mind are brought under control. When these disturbing forces are kept under check, the mind is full of peace and in that state, the enquiry into the Self continues without any hindrance and Self-realisation easily possible.",
      "The Lord makes it clear that two things are needed (1) Effort, (2) Purity. ‘Yatantah’ – the yogis strive to discover the truth, Atma. The striving must be there for Self-realisation. Without it, nothing can be gained. But this striving should be accompanied with Purity (Chita-suddhi). Then the reward is immediate. The word ‘achetasah‘ does not here refer to illiterate, ignorant men who have no idea of spiritual life at all. It refers to persons who have some ideas of spirituality, who believe in God, who have studied the Sastras, and who understand the truth intellectually. These qualifications are good no doubt, but they are not enough for direct Self-realisation. They have to acquire self-control and dispassion (vairagya); otherwise, there is no progress. If the seekers do a bit of self-examination, they will find out how strong the bonds are which bind them to the objective world, and how weak their vairagya is. Let them concentrate on how to purify the heart of all its impure sensual tendencies. The company of the wise, the correct way of Sadhana, faith in the words of the Lord, all these are necessary for the aspirant to reach the goal.",

The ignorant may ascribe that energy to themselves, but the wise know that it is all the Lord’s inexhaustible power exhibiting through the multitudinous begins of the universe. From this declaration of the Lord, we come to know that Sri Krishna, the Charioteer of Arjuna, is not simply the child of Devaki (a little ‘upadhi’ like innumerable other beings), but the all-pervading, all-supporting Paramatma. Moreover, the food one eats is nourished by the Lord’s energy, permeating the world. Without Him, there would be no food for man. So when man feeds himself he should remember the Lord from whom the food has come to him. He is the mightiest producer and also distributor. He is the giver of the food. Should we not be grateful to Lord? Should we not offer to the Lord what belongs to Him? Eating is not animal-activity, but divine work, if one knows the secret of the Lord’s indivisible hand in its production. So also, if the light of the sun and the moon is not there, the universe would be plunged in darkness. It is the light of Paramatma that shines through the Sun, Moon and Fire. Man’s life has become possible by the immeasurable energy (sakti) of the Lord. He is the supporter, the nourisher, and the dispenser. May people remember it always and remain steadfast in their love and devotion to Him.",
      "Question:How does the Lord help mankind?",
      "Answer:He permeates the earth and sustains all beings with His energy (sakti). He becomes the watery moon and nourishes the plants and herbs.",
      "Question:What then is the duty of man?",
      "Answer:He should remember the Lord in all the activities of life, by Japa, Dhyana, Samkirtan and worship."

    ],
    "commentary": [
      "In the previousverse, the Lord said that He produces the food by his energy (sakti) and that He is the supporter and nourisher of all beings. Not only does the Lord produce food, He is also the digestive energy in all living beings. The body is built by food, and the food eaten should be properly digested before it turns into blood and vital energy. The digestive Fire (Jatharagni) is the Lord Himself in the form ofvaisvanara. So the Lord is the Creator as well as the nourisher of the body. In this way, man is wholly the product of the Lord and all the energy which he possesses comes to him from the Lord. He who eats the food without offering to the Lord is a thief, misappropriating to himself what is not really his (yo bhunkte stena eva saha3.12). That is why there is thesadacharain the world of offering food to God asnaivedyambefore eating. What is eaten without such an offering is impure food. So everyone should offer his food first to God, and then a part of it to other hungry beings, and eat only the rest of it with Godly feelings. Then the very act of eating would become a yajna, and the food taken becomes nectar (Amritam).",
      "Praninam deham asritah:The Lord is in the body, very near, nay, nearest to him. Realising His presence with him one should live a pure, blissful and blessed life.",
      "Pachamyannam chaturvidham:The four-fold food (1) Bhakshyam-Food which has been eaten by mastication, (2) Bhojyam -Soft food which has to be sucked in, (3) Lehyam -that which has to be licked. (4) Choshyam -that which has to be swallowed.",
      "One can imagine how cautious he should be when he knows that the Lord is Himself the eater and the digester of food. Regulation of food habits is a necessary prerequisite of spiritual life. The body is the instrument of yoga sadhana, and food builds the body and sustains it. So everyone should practice restraint and moderation in this matter. The following principles should be observed (1) He should not eat too much (2) Sattivic food alone should be taken, Rajasic and Tamasic food should be avoided (vide 17-8, 9, 10 verses for a definition of the Sattvic, rajasic and tamasic, types of food). (3) The food taken should first be offered to the Lord. (4) The food should be earned by righteous means.",
      "It is certainly better to live on roots and leaves obtained by righteous means than on luxurious dishes got by cheating, stealth and other unrighteous (adharmic) ways. The Lord is observing from within every morsel that one eats. The law of moderation has already been enunciated by the Lord (Yuktaharaviharasya6.17).",
      "As the Chapter deals with food it has become sadachara to recite it collectively or separately at the time of eating. In Asramas, Matts and houses, this practice is followed by most people. Food eaten in this spirit is a real offering to the Lord. He accepts it. Besides, such food permeates every particle of the body with divine purity and energy. Generally after reciting this Discourse, the wise take water in their palm, repeat the 24th verse in the IV Chapter (Brahmarpanam brahmahavir) sprinkle the water on the food, and then start eating. This is Brahma Karma Samadhi.",
      "Kedar sang several other songs. After the music the Master again talked to the devotees. Nandalal, Keshab’s nephew, was also present with a few Brahmo friends. They were sitting near the Master.MASTER (to Vijay and the other devotees):“A man brought a bottle of consecrated wine for me; but I couldn’t even touch it.”VIJAY:“Ah!”MASTER:“I become intoxicated at the mere thought of God. I don’t have to take any wine. I feel drunk at the very sight of the charanamrita.5I feel as if I had drunk five bottles of liquor. When a person attains such a state he cannot help discriminating about food.”NARENDRA:“As regards food, one should take whatever comes.”MASTER:“What you say applies only to a particular state of the aspirant’s mind. No food can harm a jnani.According to theGita, the jnani himself does not eat; his eating is an offering to the Kundalini.But that does not apply to a bhakta. The present state of my mind is such that I cannot eat any food unless it is first offered to God by a brahmin priest. Formerly my state of mind was such that I would enjoy inhaling the smell of burning corpses, carried by the wind from the other side of the Ganges. It tasted very sweet to me. But nowadays I cannot eat food touched by anybody and everybody. No, I cannot. But once in a while I do. One day I was taken to see a performance of a play at Keshab’s house. They gave me luchi and curries to eat. I didn’t know whether the food was handed to me by a washerman or a barber; but I ate quite a little. (All laugh.) Rakhal had asked me to eat. (To Narendra) “With you it is all right. You are in ‘this’ as well as in ‘that’.6You can eat everything now. (To the devotees) Blessed is he who feels longing for God, though he eats pork. But shame on him whose mind dwells on ‘woman and gold’, though he eats the purest food — boiled vegetables, rice, and ghee. (Source:Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna)",
      "One day Golap-ma said to the Master: “Dr. Durga Charan of Calcutta is a reputable physician. Perhaps he can find some remedy for you.” Immediately the Master agreed to visit him. That night I stayed at Dakshineswar. Latu and Golap-ma were also there. The next morning the Master, Golap-ma, Latu, and I went to Calcutta by boat. After landing there, we rented a horse carriage and went to the doctor’s office at Beadon Square. Out of his mercy the Master asked me to sit next to him, and Golap-ma and Latu sat on the opposite seat.",
      "The doctor examined the Master’s throat and prescribed some medications. Then we went to the Ahiritola ghat and rented a boat for Dakshineswar. It was about 1:30 p.m. and none of us had had any food. The Master was hungry. He asked the boatman to anchor the boat at the Baranagore ghat and then asked me to buy some sweets from a nearby market. Golap-ma had four pice with her which she gave me. I immediately went to the market and bought some chanar murki [small, sweet cheese balls]. The Master took the packet of sweets from my hand and joyfully ate them all. He then threw the empty packet into the Ganges and drank some water from the river with his hands. He showed his satisfaction. The Master knew that the three of us were hungry, but without sharing any sweets he had eaten everything. It was amazing! As soon as his hunger was relieved, our own stomachs felt full. We looked at each other silently. Then the Master smiled and like a boy began to make jokes — which he continued all the way to Dakshineswar. We all got out of the boat, and later the three of us discussed what had happened and realized that it was a miracle.",
      "A similar event occurred when Krishna was alive and enacted his divine play. When the five Pandavas and their wife Draupadi were living in the forest during their exile, the sage Durvasa went to their cottage with his twelve hundred disciples and asked for food. According to the custom guests had to be fed, for otherwise it would be very inauspicious. Durvasa and his disciples went to the river for a bath, and while they were gone, the helpless Draupadi called on Krishna to come to the rescue. Krishna came and asked Draupadi for some food. There was nothing but a few particles of rice and a little spinach at the bottom of a cooking vessel. Krishna ate this and drank a glass of water and by doing so, filled the stomachs of Durvasa and his disciples. So it is said, “If God is pleased the whole world becomes pleased.” That day I realized this truth by observing Sri Ramakrishna’s life. (Source: God Lived with Them)",
      "One day I was extremely hungry, and the Master, as if aware of the fact, quickly took two sweetmeats from the shelf in his room. I thought he knew I was hungry and was going to give them to me, but he did just the opposite. He took them himself. He then asked me to give him a glass of water, which he drank. Then, with evident signs of satiety, he said: “Oh, how relieved I am! I am satisfied.” And strange to say, his satisfaction removed my hunger and thirst. I was reminded of the story in the Mahabharata of how Sri Krishna took a particle of spinach from the cooking pot of Draupadi and appeased the hunger of the sage Durvasa and his party. The same phenomenon revealed itself to me on that day.— Vaikuntha Nath Sanyal (Source: Ramakrishna as We Saw Him)",

      "Sarvasya:Without distinction of caste, creed, religion, race and nationality, the Lord is present in the hearts of all beings. No one needs to feel desperate that he is devoid of the Lord’s presence. The worst sinners and outcastes can ennoble their lives by giving up their evil ways, and feeling the presence of the Lord within themselves. Even the worst sinner can attain perfection, if he remembers that the background for him also is the mighty universal Lord, and he is one with Him.",
      "Thus the Gita opens the door of the highest realisation to all beings. The Lord is the background, the source, and the foundation for all. What does it matter whether the wave is small or big, for, both are the same to the ocean. The small Jiva need not fear. The Jiva is part of the Lord Himself, in the same way as the wave is part of the ocean. The trumpet call of the Lord is ‘I am in all, come to Me, I am yours.’",
      "Hridi:He, the Lord, is seated in the hearts of all. He is the nearest to all. It is gross foolishness to imagine that the Lord is not with beings, or He is far away from them. Repeatedly does the Lord declare ‘I am in the hearts of all’, thus urging man to realise his divine nature and give up all thoughts of weakness, vileness and wretchedness. He is the witness of all that one does, and He is also the punisher, if he does wrong. So thinking, everyone should evolve towards higher planes of righteousness and perfection.",
      "Smritir jnanam apoham:Memory, knowledge, loss of memory, all these are different forms of mental energy. The Lord is the foundation of the mind, and so all these mental states are caused by the Lord Himself. He is the observer of the subtlest mental processes and nothing can be hidden from Him. So, let every seeker be fully aware of the thoughts that are coming up in his mind, check them up, and entertain only those which are pure, uplifting, and inspiring.",

He who identifies himself with the physical body is Kshara Purusha. He who identifies himself with the mind is called Akshara Purusha. Compared with the body which perishes every time it is born, the mind, which endures birth after birth till the moment of liberation (Moksha), is said to be Akshara or Kutasthah (the immovable). This Akshara Purusha (Manobhimani) Jiva is not the same as the Akshara Parabrahman described in the8th Discourse. These are poles apart. Brahman is the original Sun and the Jiva is the reflection of the Sun in water. The Jiva mentioned here is different from Brahman of the 8th discourse. In the comingverse, the Lord describes Purusha who is different from Kshara Purusha and the Akshara Purusha (Jiva) who is the reflected consciousness of Paramatma in the body.",

The Supreme Purusha is ever free (nityamuktah), whereas the Jiva attains Mukti by knowledge of the Supreme Purusha.

      "From the thirteenth chapter onwards we have been talking about the One in the many. There is only that One. The third verse of the thirteenth chapter said, ‘Know Me to be that one Kṣetrajña in all the kṣetras.’ The Knower is one, the known are many. The different bodies makes it appear as if the knower also is many. But, no; in all kṣetras, there is only one Kṣetrajña, but it is conditioned by that particular kṣetra. When we investigate it, we find that there are no separate kṣetrajñas. There is only one infinite Seer, infinite Knower, and that is Brahman. That is the language of the Upaniṣads. Here, in the Gītā, it is said that He is avyaya, He is īśvara. All these things of the world are vyaya, perishable; the whole world is vyaya. We are all drawing energy and dissipating it. Ultimately, we won’t have any energy at all. That is the nature of the manifestation as these individual entities. But the source from which they come is avyaya being absolutely infinite, ever full. That is the Vedantic language.",

      "Paramatma is called the Highest Purusha, because he transcends the perishable body and the imperishable Jiva. The Jiva should go beyond his limited jivatvam-imprisonment in the cell of the body and mind-vehicles and attain his true nature as the Highest Purusha. In truth, jivatvam is an illusion. The Jiva is no other than the Supreme Purusha.",
      "Question:Why is Paramatma declared to be the highest Purusha?",
      "Answer:Because He is higher than the perishable body (Kshara) and the Jiva (Aksharam)."

    "commentary": [
      "One’s devotion to a person or thing is formed by his understanding of his true nature to some extent. The more he knows the excellence of a person, the more he loves him and the more he is devoted to him. Thus if a person knows the true nature of Paramatma, his devotion would be real and immovable. The Lord is Eternal, the essence of all bliss and blessedness. He is higher than the perishable body and the imprisoned Jiva. He is freedom and He is perfection. Such is the Supreme Purusha. It is declared here that he who knows the Lord as such, would worship Him with his whole being.If a man worships an Avatara or a saint only after knowing him as the real Purushottama, then only he will get the full benefit of such worship.",
      "Asammudhah:He should be free from delusion. Ignorance is nothing else but the feeling of attachment to perishable things. Understanding of Atma as the only Eternal Reality is Knowledge.",
      "Sah sarvavit:He who understands the Supreme Purusha is declared to be all-knowing. He is the knower of all. Brahmajnana alone is complete knowledge. Knowledge of all other things does not confer perfection of knowledge on man.",
      "Knowledge of Paramatma brings with it knowledge of everything in the world. Paramatma being known, everything is known. All the sciences and arts, all the Sastras and the Vedas, are in Him. So to know Him is to know all. Such a man becomes all-knowing (‘sarvavit‘).",
      "Sarvabhavena:As one realises the true nature of Paramatma, his faith in Him becomes strong and firm. Then he worships Him in every way, with all his heart and soul. When it is clearly seen that the objective world is every moment a vanishing dream, one naturally turns to the only reality, the Drik (seer) Atma. The whole-hearted and undivided worship of the Lord is emphasised here, and in many places too (tameva saranam gaccha sarva bhavena bharata18.62). The mind should not split into two channels – God and the world, because where the world rules, God is far away, and where God rules the heart, the world is far away. It would be utterly foolish to imagine that one can attain Atma, while every moment he is oppressed by the demands of the flesh and the desires of the mind. The seeker should have perfect mental non-attachment to the world and think of the Lord only. This fulness of devotion, the hundred percent concentration on the Lord, should be acquired by long practice and ceaseless effort.",
      "Question:Who worships the Lord with the whole-heart?",
      "Answer:He who is freed from delusion, and understands that the supreme Purusha is higher than the Kshara and Akshara Purushas, worships him with heart and soul.",
      "Question:How should the Lord be worshipped?",
      "Answer:With a full and undivided mind (Sarvabavena)."

    ],
    "commentary": [
      "The Lord declares the fruit of understanding the Supreme Purusha as distinguished from the Kshara and Akshara. He says that this Sastra, science taught by Him is the greatest secret (guhyatamam). The superlative form is used to show that this truth is the highest secret, greatest mystery to be known by man. Generally, no wise man reveals anything to a fool or a braggart. He selects his hearer by knowing his nature and character. Then only he reveals the secret. Here also the Lord has chosen Arjuna to be the recipient of this divine knowledge, because he is sinless (anagha). It is stated as a rule that Brahmavidya is not taught to persons who are devoid of the essential qualities of self-control. The seeker should first acquire mental purity (chittasuddhi) and then he gets the qualification (adhikara) to be initiated into the highest secret.",
      "If any one like Arjuna, becomes sinless by devotion, austerity, ‘dhyana’ and other practices, he is certain to obtain the Highest Knowledge from some great-souled teacher (Guru) or by some incidental factor in his life. Or the Lord Himself confers the subtlety of the intellect capable of perceiving the truth (dadami buddhi yogam tam).",
      "What is the fruit of acquiring this knowledge? He becomes (1) wise (having Self-knowledge), (2) he has accomplished all his duties. The performance of all other works in the world do not lead man to the highest state of perfection and freedom. All other works may confer merit (Punyam) by which one enjoys fruits of good life in other worlds. But still liberation is not attained. He has to be born again and again. When Brahma jnana is attained, he receives the merit of having accomplished all his duties, and has no further work to do with the body in this or in any other world. Therefore it is the duty of all seekers to rise to this plane of liberation and realise the fulness of bliss and blessedness. Without it, the cycle of birth and death continues and sorrow envelops them endlessly.",
      "Question:What is the nature of this spiritual knowledge taught by the Lord?",
      "Answer:It is the greatest secret and the highest mystery.",
      "Question:Why did the Lord teach it to Arjuna?",
      "Answer:Because Arjuna is free from sin.",
      "Question:What is the fruit of acquiring this knowledge?",
      "Answer:Man becomes (1) wise and (2) has accomplished all his duties.",
      "Question:What then is the way to become wise and of fulfilled purpose?",
      "Answer:To understand this secret knowledge is the way."
