    "translation": "Above and below spread its branches, nourished by the gunas. Sense-objects are its buds; and its clustering roots spread downward in the world of men, giving rise to action.",
    "commentary": "The tree of samsara is vividly described here. It is not a small tree. It has grown strong and firm from millions of births, and has deeply established its roots in the world. Its branches spread upto Brahma loka. Its roots are the past samskaras of action. The three Gunas are its branches. Its tender shoots grow by enjoyment of sense-objects. How then to cut this mighty tree? The branches should be struck by purifying the mind of the three Gunas; the tender shoots should be cut by dispassion towards sense-enjoyments; and the roots should be destroyed by removing the past tendencies of the mind. As all trees are sustained by their roots, this tree of samsara is sustained by deeply impregnated ‘samskaras’ or ‘vasanas’, and when they are destroyed, the whole tree falls to the ground being struck at the roots. It is there that the operation should be conducted. When the roots are cut, the branches, shoots and buds wither away in a short time. The wise man therefore should cultivate dispassion (vairagya) towards sense-objects. Dispassion brings about the cessation of the impulses and urgings of action. Where there is no action, there is no bondage, resulting from Karma. If, on the other hand, man nurtures the vasanas with raga and dvesha, he can never cut the tree and gain his freedom. He will be bound to samsara almost endlessly.",

    "commentary": "This tree of Samsara is not seen by man in the form described in the first and second verses. Why? Attached to Samsara, the ignorant do not see it as such. They do not see its beginning or end, or its present state of existence. They have not made any attempt to enquire into its real nature. They are immersed in the flood of Samsara and do not really know what it is, how it has come, and what its nature is etc. In darkness, the real nature of objects cannot be seen. Thus people live in Samsara and die in Samsara without understanding its true nature. This is Maya. Only a few awakened souls try to release themselves from its bondage, and among them only a few are able to cut the bond and attain liberation. The idea is that the darkness of ignorance is such that man is not able to realise the slavery and bondage which Samsara has imposed on him from time immemorial.",

The Jiva is imposing on himself all the limitations of the body and the mind. If the body is weak or sick, the Jiva says “I am sick;” if the mind is sad, the Jiva says ‘I am sad’. Thus to the body. the Jiva who in truth, is Paramatma Himself, has developed a false identification and a fictitious personality, limited by time, space and causation. This is ignorance (avidya or Maya).",

In his very body tenanted by the jiva, who is eating, drinking sleeping, acting, enjoying and suffering, that Paramatman can be seen by right discrimination which opens the eye of knowledge (Jnanachakshushah). On account of the dominating of the objective phenomena, the deluded are not able to see Him. If he turns the mind outside, the world is reflected in it; If he turns it inside God is realised. If the mirror is turned to us, we see ourselves. If it is turned outside, the whole of the phenomenal world is seen. If the mind is turned within, kept calm, pure and firm, Atma is beheld. This Atma is seen only by such sages who can discriminate between the real and the unreal, the seer and the seen. (Seeing the Atma means, self-realisation.)",

The impure-minded people (akritatmah) do not see the Atma, in spite of their sadhana. These also do japa, dhyana and other practices, but they fail because the heart is impure, (i.e. vitiated by powerful vasanas binding them to the external world). Some people attempt to realise Atma by a Study of sastras, without eradicating the impurities of the heart. Some others carry on a show of external devotion and meditation. They do not possess real self-control, and so they fail in their search for Paramatma. We hear that the Lord insists on purity of heart as the essential condition for Atmajnana. If there is no Purity, there is no Atmajnana. When Purity is attained, Atma is realised. The path is clear.",

From this declaration of the Lord, we come to know that Sri Krishna, the Charioteer of Arjuna, is not simply the child of Devaki (a little ‘upadhi’ like innumerable other beings), but the all-pervading, all-supporting Paramatma. Moreover, the food one eats is nourished by the Lord’s energy, permeating the world. Without Him, there would be no food for man. So when man feeds himself he should remember the Lord from whom the food has come to him. He is the mightiest producer and also distributor. He is the giver of the food. Should we not be grateful to Lord? Should we not offer to the Lord what belongs to Him? Eating is not animal-activity, but divine work, if one knows the secret of the Lord’s indivisible hand in its production. So also, if the light of the sun and the moon is not there, the universe would be plunged in darkness. It is the light of Paramatma that shines through the Sun, Moon and Fire. Man’s life has become possible by the immeasurable energy (sakti) of the Lord. He is the supporter, the nourisher, and the dispenser. May people remember it always and remain steadfast in their love and devotion to Him.",

Not only does the Lord produce food, He is also the digestive energy in all living beings. The body is built by food, and the food eaten should be properly digested before it turns into blood and vital energy. The digestive Fire (Jatharagni) is the Lord Himself in the form ofvaisvanara. So the Lord is the Creator as well as the nourisher of the body. In this way, man is wholly the product of the Lord and all the energy which he possesses comes to him from the Lord. He who eats the food without offering to the Lord is a thief, misappropriating to himself what is not really his (yo bhunkte stena eva saha3.12). That is why there is thesadacharain the world of offering food to God asnaivedyambefore eating. What is eaten without such an offering is impure food. So everyone should offer his food first to God, and then a part of it to other hungry beings, and eat only the rest of it with Godly feelings. Then the very act of eating would become a yajna, and the food taken becomes nectar (Amritam).",

    "word_by_word_meaning": "sarvasya—of all living beings; cha—and; aham—I; hṛidi—in the hearts; sanniviṣhṭaḥ—seated; mattaḥ—from Me; smṛitiḥ—memory; jñānam—knowledge; apohanam—forgetfulness; cha—as well as; vedaiḥ—by the Vedas; cha—and; sarvaiḥ—all; aham—I; eva—alone; vedyaḥ—to be known; vedānta-kṛit—the author of the Vedant; veda-vit—the knower of the meaning of the Vedas; eva—alone; cha—and; aham—I",
    "translation": "And I am seated in the hearts of all; from Me are memory and knowledge, and their loss as well. It is I alone who am to be known through all the Vedas; I am indeed the Author of Vedānta and the Knower of the Vedas.",
    "commentary": "Sarvasya:Without distinction of caste, creed, religion, race and nationality, the Lord is present in the hearts of all beings. No one needs to feel desperate that he is devoid of the Lord’s presence. The worst sinners and outcastes can ennoble their lives by giving up their evil ways, and feeling the presence of the Lord within themselves. Even the worst sinner can attain perfection, if he remembers that the background for him also is the mighty universal Lord, and he is one with Him.",

    "translation": "There are two beings in the world: the Perishable and the Imperishable. The Perishable comprises all creatures, and the Imperishable is said to be the Unchanging.",
    "commentary": "Kshara Purusha, Akshara Purusha, and Purushothama– This Discourse deals with these three Purushas. First, the Kshara Purusha is explained. He who identifies himself with the physical body is Kshara Purusha. He who identifies himself with the mind is called Akshara Purusha. Compared with the body which perishes every time it is born, the mind, which endures birth after birth till the moment of liberation (Moksha), is said to be Akshara or Kutasthah (the immovable). This Akshara Purusha (Manobhimani) Jiva is not the same as the Akshara Parabrahman described in the8th Discourse. These are poles apart. Brahman is the original Sun and the Jiva is the reflection of the Sun in water. The Jiva mentioned here is different from Brahman of the 8th discourse. In the comingverse, the Lord describes Purusha who is different from Kshara Purusha and the Akshara Purusha (Jiva) who is the reflected consciousness of Paramatma in the body.",

    "translation": "But there is another Being, the Highest, called the Supreme Self, who, as the Immutable, pervades and sustains the three worlds.",
    "commentary": "Different from the perishable bodies, and the Jiva, migrating from body to body, is the Supreme Purusha. He is distinct from the Jiva, who is only a reflected being of Paramatma. Is not the Supreme Purusha higher than the perishing bodies, and the Jiva bound by delusion to the vehicles of the body, senses and mind? The Supreme Purusha is ever free (nityamuktah), whereas the Jiva attains Mukti by knowledge of the Supreme Purusha. The Jiva is associated with the three Gunas, but Paramatma is free from the Gunas; He is Gunatita. Therefore He is known as the Supreme Purusha or Purushottama.",

    "commentary": "Paramatma is called the Highest Purusha, because he transcends the perishable body and the imperishable Jiva. The Jiva should go beyond his limited jivatvam-imprisonment in the cell of the body and mind-vehicles and attain his true nature as the Highest Purusha. In truth, jivatvam is an illusion. The Jiva is no other than the Supreme Purusha.",

    "commentary": "One’s devotion to a person or thing is formed by his understanding of his true nature to some extent. The more he knows the excellence of a person, the more he loves him and the more he is devoted to him. Thus if a person knows the true nature of Paramatma, his devotion would be real and immovable. The Lord is Eternal, the essence of all bliss and blessedness. He is higher than the perishable body and the imprisoned Jiva. He is freedom and He is perfection. Such is the Supreme Purusha. It is declared here that he who knows the Lord as such, would worship Him with his whole being.If a man worships an Avatara or a saint only after knowing him as the real Purushottama, then only he will get the full benefit of such worship.",

    "commentary": "The Lord declares the fruit of understanding the Supreme Purusha as distinguished from the Kshara and Akshara. He says that this Sastra, science taught by Him is the greatest secret (guhyatamam). The superlative form is used to show that this truth is the highest secret, greatest mystery to be known by man. Generally, no wise man reveals anything to a fool or a braggart. He selects his hearer by knowing his nature and character. Then only he reveals the secret. Here also the Lord has chosen Arjuna to be the recipient of this divine knowledge, because he is sinless (anagha). It is stated as a rule that Brahmavidya is not taught to persons who are devoid of the essential qualities of self-control. The seeker should first acquire mental purity (chittasuddhi) and then he gets the qualification (adhikara) to be initiated into the highest secret.",
