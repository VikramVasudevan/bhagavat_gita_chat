      "Dhritarashtra said: Having assembled on the holy plain in Kurukshetra desirous of fighting the battle, what did my people and the Pandavas do? O Sanjaya! (1.1)",
      "Sanjaya said: On seeing the Pāndava army arrayed for battle, King Duryodhana went to his teacher and spoke these words: (1.2)",
      "O teacher, behold the great army of the sons of Pāndu arrayed by your talented disciple, the son of Drupada. (1.3)",
      "In that army are mighty archers and heroes, in battle equal to Bhima and Arjuna: Yuyudhāna, Virāta, and Drupada, each a mahāratha; Heroic Dhrishtaketu, Chekitāna, and the king of Kāśi; Purujit, Kuntibhoja, and Śaivya, all the best of men; Powerful Yudhāmanyu, brave Uttamaujā, Subhadrā’s son, and the sons of Draupadi— all mahārathas indeed. (1.4-1.6)",
      "O best of the twice-born, let me also recount to you the leaders of my own army, those distinguished amongst ourselves. I shall name them, that you may know them all: (1.7)",
      "Yourself and Bhishma and Karna; Kripa, who is ever victorious in war; Aśvatthāmā, Vikarna, Jayadratha, and Somadatta’s son; And many other heroes besides, armed with many weapons, each well skilled in battle, and all resolved to lay down their lives to serve my cause. (1.8-1.9)",
      "But this army of ours, protected by Bhishma, is unlimited, and that army of theirs, protected by Bhima, is limited. (1.10)",
      "Now take your proper places in front of your marshalled troops and protect Bhishma alone. (1.11)",
      "Bhishma the grandsire, the glorious, the oldest of the Kurus, gave forth a lion-roar and blew his conch, causing joy to Duryodhana. (1.12)",
      "Then conchs and kettle-drums, tabors and trumpets and cow-horns suddenly blared forth; and the sound was stupendous. (1.13)",
      "Whereupon Mādhava and Pāndava, seated in their magnificent chariot yoked to white horses, also blew their celestial conchs. (1.14)",
      "Hrishikeśa blew His conch, the Pānchajanya; Dhananjaya, the Devadatta; and Vrikodara, the doer of fearful deeds, blew his great conch, the Paundra. King Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, blew his conch, the Anantavijaya; and Nakula and Sahadeva blew the Sughosha and the Manipushpaka. The great archer, the king of Kāśi; the great warrior Śikhandi; Dhristadyumna and Virāta; the unconquered Sātyaki; Drupada, and the sons of Draupadi, and the mighty son of Subhadrā, O Lord of the Earth, each blew his own conch. (1.15-1.18)",
      "And that tumult, resounding through heaven and earth, rent the hearts of Dhritarāshtra’s followers. (1.19)",
      "O King! Now seeing the Kauravas arrayed in battle order and the discharge of weapons about to begin, Arjuna took up his bow and spoke these words to Lord Krishna. (1.20)",
      "Arjuna said: O Achyuta, between the two armies draw up my chariot, that I may behold those who stand there eager to fight, and may know, on the eve of battle, with whom I must contend. (1.21-1.22)",
      "I would observe these warriors assembled here for the battle wishing to please the evil-minded Duryodhana. (1.23)",
      "Sanjaya said: Advised thus by Arjuna Lord Krishna placed the noble chariot in the middle of the two armies, and in front of Bhishma and Drona, and all the Kings, and said: ‘O Arjuna! Behold those Kauravas gathered here.’ (1.24-1.25)",
      "There Arjuna saw fathers, grand-fathers, teachers, uncles, brothers, sons, grandsons, companions, fathers-in-law, and friends in both the armies. (1.26)",
      "Casting his eyes on all these kinsmen stationed on opposing sides, the son of Kunti was overcome with deep pity and sorrowfully spoke. (1.27)",
      "Arjuna said: O Krishna, at the sight of these my kinsmen, assembled here eager to give battle, my limbs fail and my mouth is parched. My body is shaken and my hair stands on end. The bow Gāndiva slips from my hand and my skin is on fire. I cannot hold myself steady; my mind seems to whirl. O Keśava, I see omens of evil. (1.28-1.30)",
      "O Krishna! I see many ill-omens and I do not understand what good could come by killing my own people in battle. (1.31)",
      "O Krishna! I do not desire victory or kingdom or pleasures. Of what avail are these kingdom, enjoyment, or even life itself to us. (1.32)",
      "Those for whose sake we desire kingdom, enjoyments, and pleasures—teachers, fathers, sons, grandfathers, maternal uncles, fathers-in law, brothers-in-law, grandsons and other relations are all standing here ready for battle, having abandoned their wealth and very life even. (1.33-1.34)",
      "These, O Madhusudana, I would not kill, though they should kill me, even for the sake of sovereignty over the three worlds— how much less for this earth! (1.35)",
      "O Janārdana, what joy can be ours in killing these sons of Dhritarāshtra? Sin alone will possess us if we kill these felons. (1.36)",
      "Therefore we ought not to kill our kinsmen, the sons of Dhritarāshtra; for, O Mādhava, how can we ever be happy by killing our own people? (1.37)",
      "Though they, their understanding overcome by greed, perceive no evil in the decay of families and no sin in hostility to friends, why, O Janārdana, should not we, who clearly perceive the evil in the decay of families, learn to refrain from this sin? (1.38-1.39)",
      "With the decay of a family, perish its dharmas, which have existed from time out of mind. With the ending of the dharmas, adharma overwhelms the whole family. When adharma overwhelms the family, O Krishna, the women of the family become corrupt; and when, O Krishna, the women are corrupt, there arises a mixing of castes. This mixture leads into hell the family itself as well as those who destroy it; for their ancestors fall, deprived of the offerings of rice-balls and water. (1.40-1.42)",
      "By these evil deeds of the destroyers of families, which result in the mixing of castes, the eternal dharmas of caste and family are uprooted. We have heard it said, O Janārdana, that inevitably the men whose family dharmas are destroyed dwell in hell. (1.43-1.44)",
      "Alas, we are resolved to commit a great sin, in that we are ready to slay our kinsmen to satisfy our greed for the pleasure of a kingdom! (1.45)",
      "Far better would it be for me if the sons of Dhritarāshtra, weapons in hand, should slay me in the battle, unarmed and unresisting. (1.46)",
      "Sanjaya said: Arjuna, having spoken thus on the battlefield, cast aside his bow and arrow and sank down on his chariot-seat, his mind overcome with grief. (1.47)"

      "In this manner, when Arjuna was plunged in a state of despondency, with eyes blurred with tears, Lord Krishna addressed this speech to him. (2.1)",
      "The Blessed Lord said:O Arjuna! Whence, in this critical situation, has this mental dejection takes hold of you, shameful and Heaven-excluding? (2.2)",
      "O Arjuna! Do not yield to impotence. It does not befit you. Cast off this wretched weakness of heart. Arise, O scorcher of enemies! (2.3)",
      "Arjuna Said:O Krishna! Bhishma and Drona are my teachers fit to be worshipped. How can I attack them with arrows in the battle? (2.4)",
      "It would be better, indeed, to live on alms in this world rather than to slay these high-souled teachers. But if I kill them, even here I shall enjoy wealth and desires stained with their blood. (2.5)",
      "We do not know which would be the better for us: that we should conquer them or they should conquer us. Arrayed against us stand the very sons of Dhritarāshtra, after slaying whom we should not wish to live. (2.6)",
      "(O Krishna!) My mind is distracted by the taint of pity and I am ignorant of what my duty is, and so, I ask you to teach me what is good for me. I am your disciple. I take refuge in you. (2.7)",
      "I can find no means to drive away this grief which is drying up my senses. I will not be able to dispel it even if I win a prosperous, unrivaled kingdom on earth with sovereignty like the demigods in heaven. (2.8)",
      "Sanjaya Said: Having spoke thus, Arjuna, the destroyer of foes, finally said to Lord Krishna, “I will not fight” and became silent. (2.9)",
      "O king Dhritarashtra! Seeing Arjuna lamenting in the middle of two armies, Lord Krishna, as if laughing loud, spoke these words. (2.10)",
      "The Lord said: O Arjuna! You grieve for those for whom there need be no sorrow, yet you speak words of wisdom. The wise do not grieve for the dead or living. (2.11)",
      "Never was there a time when I did not exist, nor you, nor these kings of men. Never will there be a time hereafter when any of us shall cease to be. (2.12)",
      "Just as the man in this body passes through the various stages of boyhood, youth, and old age, like so, he passes into another body after death. The wise know it and are not deluded. (2.13)",
      "Contact of the senses with the objects produces heat and cold, pain and pleasure. These experiences come and go, and are impermanent. Endure them, O Arjuna! (2.14)",
      "The firm man who is not affected by pain and pleasure, who remains equal-minded, surely is fit for immortality, O Arjuna, Chief of mortals! (2.15)",
      "The unreal has no being, the real has no non-being. The final truth of these two has been seen indeed by those who have experienced the essence of things. (2.16)",
      "(O Arjuna!) Know thatAtmaby which the whole universe is pervaded is indestructible. No one can cause the destruction of the imperishable. (2.17)",
      "These bodies which belong to the real imperishable, unknowable Atma are said to be subject to an end; therefore fight, O Arjuna!t. (2.18)",
      "He who thinks thatAtmaslays, or he who thinks thatAtmais Slain, both these do not know the Truth.Atmadoes not slay, nor is slain. (2.19)",
      "Atma is not born, nor does it ever die; after having been it does not cease to be, unborn, eternal, changeless and ancient, it is not killed when the body is destroyed. (2.20)",
      "O Arjuna! He who knows thatAtmais birthless, deathless, real, and imperishable, whom can he slay or cause to be slain? (2.21)",
      "Just as a man cast off his worn-out clothes and puts on new ones so also the Self throws away its worn-out bodies and takes other fresh bodies. (2.22)",
      "Weapons cannot cut, fire cannot burn, water cannot wet, wind cannot dry up thisAtma. (2.23)",
      "The Atma cannot be cut, cannot be burnt, cannot be wetted, and also cannot be dried up. It is eternal, all-pervading, firm, immovable, and ancient. (2.24)",
      "This self is unknowable by the senses, unthinkable by the mind, and is not subject to any kind of change. Knowing this, you should not grieve. (2.25)",
      "O mighty-armed Arjuna! Even if you think that Self is constantly born and dies, you should not grieve in this way. (2.26)",
      "For to that which is born, death is certain, and to that which is dead, birth is certain. Therefore you should not grieve over the unavoidable. (2.27)",
      "All beings are unmanifest in their beginning, O Bhārata, manifest in their middle state, and unmanifest again in their end. Why, then, lament for them? (2.28)",
      "Some look on the Self as a wonder; some speak of It as a wonder; some hear of It as a wonder; still others, though hearing, do not understand It at all. (2.29)",
      "O Arjuna! The Self existing in the body of all beings is never slain. So it is not right for you to grieve for any creature. (2.30)",
      "And moreover, considering your own duty, you should not waver, for, there is nothing higher for a Kshatriya than a righteous war.(2.31)",
      "Happy indeed are the kshatriyas, O Pārtha, to whom comes such a war, offering itself unsought, opening the gate to heaven.. (2.32)",
      "But if you do not fight this righteous war you would incur sin by abandoning your own duty, name, and fame. (2.33)",
      "And also, these people will speak of your everlasting dishonor, and to one who is honored, dishonor is worse than death. (2.34)",
      "Moreover, those great warriors from whom you received honor formerly would think that you turned away from battle out of fear, and regard you with little respect hereafter. (2.35)",
      "Your enemies belittle your ability, and in various ways speak words of ill-fame and shame about you. What is there more painful than this? (2.36)",
      "If you are killed in the battle, you will go to heaven; if you win, you will enjoy the earth. Therefore arise, O son of Kunti, resolved to fight. (2.37)",
      "Having an equal mind in pain and pleasure, gain and loss, victory and defeat, engage in battle and thereby you will not incur sin. (2.38)",
      "O Arjuna! So far the knowledge of Sankhya Yoga about Atma is declared. Now hear the knowledge of Karma Yoga, knowing which you shall cast off the bondage of work. (2.39)",
      "In this, no effort is ever lost and no harm is ever done. Even very little of this dharma saves a man from the Great Fear. (2.40)",
      "O Arjuna! There is only one faith and thought for those who practice this Karma Yoga. The minds of others are divided into various branches, and their thoughts and speculations are endless.  (2.41)",
      "O Arjuna! The unwise utter flowery speech, taking pleasure in the laudatory words of the Vedas, and say that there is nothing else but pleasures and enjoyments either here or in Heaven. They are full of desire, with heaven as their highest goal, leading to new births as the effect of their own Karma, and they engage themselves in a multiplicity of specific works for the purpose of acquiring enjoyments and prosperity. The mind of such men who are drawn away by attachment to pleasure and wealth, cannot be concentrated to remain fixed in the ecstasy of divine contemplation. (2.42-2.44)",
      "The first part of the Vedas (Karma Kanda) deal with material things pertaining to the three Gunas. One should transcend the three Gunas, become free from the operation of the pairs of opposites, take refuge in the pure sattvic state, and firmly establish himself in Atma.(2.45)",
      "To an enlightened person who has known the Self, all the Vedas are of as much use as is a reservoir of water in a place where there is a flood. (2.46)",
      "You have the right to work only, and not to the fruits of work. Let not the fruit of action be your motive, nor let your attachment be to inaction. (2.47)",
      "O Arjuna! Steadfast in Yoga, giving up all attachment, unmindful of success or failure, do your work. Such equanimity of mind is called Yoga. (2.48)",
      "O Arjuna! Work with attachment is far inferior to nishkama karma. Therefore seek refuge in desireless action with equanimity of mind. Those who work for fruits and rewards are wrecked.(2.49)",
      "The man of equanimity born of wisdom releases himself both from good and bad even in this life. Therefore strive for nishkama karma with an equal mind. Yoga is skill in action. (2.50)",
      "Wise men endowed with equanimity, having abandoned the fruits of action, go to the abode beyond all sorrow and evil. (2.51)",
      "When your mind has crossed the mire of delusion, you will achieve indifference regarding things already heard and things yet to be heard. (2.52)",
      "When your intellect which is perplexed by hearing the various sastras becomes steady and immovable in ecstatic concentration, then you shall attain union with the Supreme Being.(2.53)",
      "Arjuna said: O Krishna! What are the characteristics of a man of steady wisdom? How does the man merged in the super-conscious state, sit and move? (2.54)",
      "The Lord said: When a man renounces completely all the desires of the mind, and when he is fully satisfied with his mind fixed in Atma, then he is declared to be a man of steady wisdom. (2.55)",
      "He whose mind is not troubled in sorrow, who does not hanker after pleasures and is free from attachment fear and hatred, is called the sage of steady wisdom. (2.56)",
      "He who has no attachment to anything anywhere, who does not rejoice and hate when good and bad things happen, his wisdom is fixed and steady. (2.57)",
      "When the yogi, like the tortoise drawing back its limbs into its own shell, withdraws all the senses from the sense objects, his wisdom is firmly fixed. (2.58)",
      "When a man rejects the sense objects by withdrawing the senses, he becomes free from the sense world only. The longing or taste for them still remains in the mind. Even this longing is removed when the self is perceived. (2.59)",
      "O Arjuna! The turbulent senses carry away the mind even of the learned man though he is striving to control them.(2.60)",
      "Having restrained all the senses the harmonized should sit intent on me. His wisdom is steady whose senses are under control. (2.61)",
      "As a man contemplates sense-objects, attachment for them arises, from attachment, desire for them will be born, from desire arises anger, from anger comes delusion, from delusion, comes loss of memory, from loss of memory, comes destruction of discrimination, and from destruction of discrimination he perishes.(2.62 & 2.63)",
      "But the self-controlled man free from attraction and repulsion, with his senses under restraint though moving among objects, attains peace. (2.64)",
      "When a man attains peace, all sorrow and suffering caused by the unbalanced mind and rebellious senses come to an end. By peace and purity, the mind is soon fixed in the Self. (2.65)",
      "The man whose mind is not under his control has no Self-knowledge and no contemplation either. Without contemplation he can have no peace; and without peace, how can he have happiness? (2.66)",
      "As a strong wind sweeps away a boat on the water, even one of the senses on which the mind focuses can carry away the discrimination. (2.67)",
      "Therefore, O Arjuna! his knowledge is steady whose senses are completely restrained from all sense objects. (2.68)",
      "That which is, night to all beings, in it the sage is awake; where all beings are awake, that is the night for the sage who sees (the Self). (2.69)",
      "As the ocean is filled with water flowing into it from all sides and remains immovable, so the man into whom all desires flow, but is not a bit affected attains peace and not the man who craves the desires. (2.70)",
      "That man who lives completely free from desires, without longing, devoid of the sense of “I” and “mine,” attains peace.(2.71)",
      "Having obtained this Brahmi state man is not deluded. Being established in this even at the end of life man attains oneness with Brahman (Moksha). (2.72)"

      "Arjuna said: O Krishna! If your belief is that knowledge is superior to action, then why do you engage me in this dreadful act of battle? (3.1)",
      "With these apparently contradictory words, You seem to confuse my understanding. Therefore tell me definitely that one thing by which I shall reach the Highest Goal. (3.2)",
      "The Blessed Lord said: O sinless Arjuna! In ancient times two paths of spiritual description were spoken by me – the Jnana yoga for the followers of the path of knowledge, and Karma yoga for the followers of the path of action. (3.3)",
      "Man does not match the actionless state of Brahman by mere non-performance of work, nor does he attain perfection by renunciation only. (3.4)",
      "No one can live even for a moment without doing work. Everyone without his will is made to do work by the qualities born of Prakriti. (3.5)",
      "The man of deluded understanding who restraining the organs of the action sits contemplating the sense objects with the mind is called a hypocrite. (3.6)",
      "But, O Arjuna! he who controls the senses with the mind, and commences the discipline of Karma yoga by his organs of action without attachment, is the best. (3.7)",
      "Doing the work prescribed by the Sastras is superior to inaction. By inaction, even maintenance of the body for you would not be possible (3.8)",
      "O Arjuna! Works other than those performed for the sake of sacrifice (Yajna) binds this world. So perform work for sacrifice without attachment. (3.9)",
      "Having created mankind together with yajna in the beginning, Brahma (Creator) said – “By this shall you propagate; it shall be to you the milk-cow of desires, the wish-fulfilling heavenly cow Kamadhenu.” (3.10)",
      "Nourish the Gods with Yajna, and they shall nourish you, and thus nourishing one another both men and Gods you shall attain the highest good. (3.11)",
      "Nourished by sacrifice, the Gods, give you desirable enjoyments. He who enjoys objects given by the Gods without offering them is verily a thief. (3.12)",
      "The righteous who offer food to the Gods in sacrifice and eat the remnants are freed from all sins. But those who cook food to satisfy their own needs, are sinners and verily eat sin.  (3.13)",
      "Beings are born of food, food is produced from rain, rain arises from yajna, yajna is born of action, action arises from Vedas, Vedas are born from the Imperishable Paramatma; therefore know that the Supreme Being is established in the yajna. (3.14 & 3.15)",
      "The man who does not follow the cycle thus set revolving is a sinner rejoicing in sense-pleasures and he lives in vain. (3.16)",
      "But he who rejoices, who is contented, who finds happiness in Atma only, has no work to perform. (3.17)",
      "For him, there is in this world no interest whatsoever by work done or not done. He does not depend upon any being for any object. (3.18)",
      "Therefore that work which should be done, do it well always without attachment. He who performs all the prescribed duties in a detached spirit will attain the Supreme. (3.19)",
      "King Janaka and others attained perfection by action. Even having in view the need to show the right path to the masses, you should work. (3.20)",
      "What-so-ever a great man does, that other men do; whatever he sets up as the standard, that the world follows. (3.21)",
      "There is no duty for me to do in the three worlds. There is nothing unattained or to be attained for me. And yet I am also engaged in work. (3.22)",
      "If I am not engaged in action always, without relaxation, men follow my path in every way, O Arjuna! (3.23)",
      "These worlds would perish if I do not perform work; I would be the cause of the confusion of species and the destruction of these beings. (3.24)",
      "O Arjuna! As the ignorant men work with attachment to action, so should the wise act without attachment, for the welfare of the world. (3.25)",
      "The wise man should not disturb and confuse the minds of the ignorant attached to action. By performing all actions with yogic equanimity, they should make the ignorant do accordingly. (3.26)",
      "By the qualities of nature, actions are performed in all cases, but one whose mind is deluded by egoism thinks “I am the doer”. (3.27)",
      "O mighty-armed Arjuna! But the knower of Truth understands the divisions of qualities and functions. He knows that the qualities in the form of senses function amidst the objects of the senses, and he, as the Supreme Self, is not affected by them. Thus knowing, he remains unattached. (3.28)",
      "The man of knowledge should not confuse the mind of those men of imperfect understanding who, deluded by the Gunas of Nature, are attached to action in the material world. (3.29)",
      "Renouncing all actions in Me with the mind fixed in Self, free from hope and egoism, fight without mental agitation. (3.30)",
      "Those men who, with faith and free from ill-will, practice this my teaching, are also freed from the bondage of action. (3.31)",
      "But those who carp at my teaching and do not practise it, know them as men deluded in all knowledge, devoid of discrimination and doomed to destruction. (3.32)",
      "Even a wise man acts according to his own nature. Beings follow nature; what can restraint do? (3.33)",
      "In each of the senses abide attraction and repulsion for the objects of the senses. One should not come under their sway, for they are man’s enemies. (3.34)",
      "One’s own duty, ill-performed and without merit, is better than the duty of another well-discharged. Better is death in discharging one’s own duty. Another’s duty is fraught with fear. (3.35)",
      "Arjuna said:O Krishna! Constrained by force as it were, by what does man commit sin even against his wish? (3.36)",
      "The Blessed Lord said: It is desire, it is anger, born of Rajoguna (the impulse of action), all-consuming and all-evil. Know this as the enemy here. (3.37)",
      "As fire is enveloped by smoke, as a mirror by dust, as an embryo by the amnion, so this knowledge of the Self is enveloped by Kama and Krodha. (3.38)",
      "O Arjuna! Knowledge of the Self is covered by this everlasting foe of the wise in the form of desire, insatiable like fire. (3.39)",
      "The senses, the mind, and the intellect are the seat of kama. Functioning through them this kama deluded the embodied by veiling the wisdom. (3.40)",
      "O Arjuna! Therefore, having controlled the senses in the beginning, kill surely this kama, the sinful destroyer of knowledge and Self-realisation. (3.41)",
      "They say that the senses are superior (to the body), superior to the senses is the mind, superior to the mind is the intellect, but superior than the intellect is He (the Atman). (3.42)",
      "O mighty-armed Arjuna! Thus, having known what is greater than the intellect (i.e.) Atma, and restraining the mind by the intellect conquer the foe (kama) in the form of desire which is indeed hard to overcome.. (3.43)"

      "Content with whatsoever he gets without efforts, free from the pains of opposites, free from malice, balanced in success and failure, though acting, he is not bound. (4.22)",
      "Of the man who is devoid of attachment, who is liberated, whose mind is established in knowledge, the whole action performed in the spirit of sacrifice is dissolved. (4.23)",
      "The oblation is Brahman, the offerings are Brahman, the sacrifice is Brahman, and by absorption in action which is Brahman, Brahman alone shall be reached by him (by the sacrifice). (4.24)",
      "Some yogis perform sacrifice pertaining to the Gods only, others by the union of the self (jiva) with Brahman, offer the Jiva as sacrifice in the fire of Brahman. (4.25)",
      "Others sacrifice the senses like the organ of hearing etc., in the fires of sense – restraint, and some others sacrifice the sense-objects like sound etc., in the fire of the senses. (4.26)",
      "Others sacrifice all the functions of the senses and the functions of the vital energy (prana) in the fire of the yoga of self-control, illumined by Knowledge. (4.27)",
      "Others offer wealth, austerity and Yoga as sacrifice and again others, the ascetics of rigid vows offer study and knowledge as sacrifice. (4.28)",
      "Some, again, constantly practising the regulation of prāna, offer the oblation of prāna into apāna, and apāna into prāna, or stop the passage of both prāna and apāna. Yet others, restricting their food, offer their prānas in the prānas. (4.29)",
      "Others of regulated food, sacrifice the life – breaths in the life – breaths; all these also are are knowers of sacrifice whose sins are destroyed by sacrifice. (4.30)",
      "Those who eat the remnants of sacrifice which is nectar, go to eternal Brahman; to the non- sacrificer, even this world is not, how then can he get a higher world? (4.31)",

      "O scorcher of foes! Knowledge-sacrifice is superior to sacrifice performed with objects. All actions, O Arjuna, in their entirety, culminate in Knowledge. (4.33)",
      "Know that (Knowledge) by long prostration, question, and service (to the master). The sages who have realised the truth will instruct you in that knowledge. (4.34)",
      "O Arjuna! Having obtained this knowledge, you will not thus be deluded again and by this Knowledge, you will see all beings in your Self and also in Me. (4.35)",
      "Even if you are the most sinful of all sinners you shall cross all sin by the raft of Knowledge. (4.36)",
      "O Arjuna! Just as blazing fire reduces wood to ashes, even so, the fire of, Knowledge destroys all actions. (4.37)",
      "Indeed there is nothing so pure as Knowledge in this world. He who is perfected in Nishkama Karma finds that wisdom by himself in Atma in due season. (4.38)",
      "The man of faith, having Knowledge as his supreme goal having controlled the senses, obtains knowledge of Atma, and having obtained that enjoys everlasting peace.  (4.39)",
      "But the ignorant man, the faithless man, the doubting man goes to destruction. For the doubting self, there is no happiness either in this world or the next. (4.40)",

      "Renunciation and Yoga of Action, both lead to the highest bliss. But of these two, Yoga of Action is superior to the renunciation of action. (5.2)",
      "O Arjuna! He who neither hates nor desires should be known as of eternal renunciation; He who is not subject to the pairs of opposites is easily set free from bondage. (5.3)",
      "Children, not the wise, say that Jnana yoga and karma yoga are distinct: He who is truly established in either of them obtains the fruit of both. (5.4)",
      "That state (Moksha) reached by men of Knowledge is also reached by men of Action (Karma yogis). He who sees the oneness of Jnana and Karma, really sees. (5.5)",
      "O Arjuna! But renunciation is difficult to attain without the yoga of action. The sage who is harmonised in Yoga quickly goes to Brahman. (5.6)",
      "He who is devoted to the yoga of action, with heart purified, with mind-controlled and senses subdued, though acting, is not tainted. (5.7)",
      "The harmonised yogi who knows the essence of things, thinks “I do nothing”, seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating, moving, sleeping, breathing, speaking, giving, grasping, opening, and closing the eyelids even. He is convinced that the senses move among the objects of the senses. (5.8 & 5.9)",
      "He who acts placing all actions in the eternal Brahman, giving up attachment, is unaffected by sin like the lotus by water. (5.10)",
      "The devotees of karma yoga act for self-purification with body, mind, intellect and also senses, abandoning all attachment. (5.11)",
      "The harmonised yogi, abandoning the fruits of action attains final peace, while the non-united one impelled by desire for the fruits of action is bound. (5.12)",
      "Mentally renouncing all actions and self-controlled, the embodied being, rests happily in the nine-gated city (body) neither acting nor causing others to act. (5.13)",
      "The Lord (Atma) does not create agency, nor action, nor the union of action and its fruit; but Nature leads to action. (5.14)",
      "The Lord does not receive either the evil or good of anyone. Knowledge is enveloped by ignorance, and by it, beings are deluded. (5.15)",
      "But for those whose ignorance is destroyed by the knowledge of Atma that Knowledge, like the sun, reveals the Supreme Brahman. (5.16)",
      "With their intellect absorbed in That, their Self being That, established in that, they go from whence there is no return and their sins are dispelled by knowledge. (5.17)",
      "The sages look with equal eye on a Brahmana endowed with knowledge and humility, on a cow, on an elephant, on a dog and on the outcaste who feeds on dog’s flesh. (5.18)",
      "Even here (while living in this body) birth and death (samsara) are overcome by those whose mind is established in equality; Brahman is untainted and is the same in all; therefore in brahman, they rest.(5.19)",

      "He who performs the prescribed duty without depending on the fruits of work is a sannyasi and a yogi, and not he who has merely ceased performing sacrifices such as Agnihotra yajna or abandoned bodily activities. (6.1)",
      "O Arjuna! That which is called sannyasa, know that to be yoga also; no one who has not given up desire can ever become a yogi. (6.2)",
      "For the sage aspiring to ascend to yoga, action is said to be the means; and for the same sage enthroned in yoga serenity is called the means. (6.3)",
      "When the sage feels no attachment for sense-objects and actions, renouncing the ego-centric will (samkalpa) then he is said to be enthroned in yoga. (6.4)",
      "Let a man be lifted up by his own self; let him not lower himself; for he himself is his friend, and he himself is his enemy. (6.5)",
      "For those who have conquered the mind, it is their friend. For those who have failed to do so, the mind works like an enemy. (6.6)",
      "The man who has subdued the mind and is full of peace experiences the Supreme Self under all conditions in heat and cold, pleasure and pain, honour and dishonour. (The mind of such a man experiences the Self under all conditions). (6.7)",
      "The yogi who is satisfied with the knowledge of the Sastras and experience of the Self, who is immovable, who has conquered the senses, who look with an equal eye on mud, stone and gold, is said to be united or harmonised in yoga. (6.8)",
      "He who is equal-minded towards the good-hearted, friends, enemies, the indifferent, neutrals, haters, relations, towards the righteous and also the wicked, excels. (6.9)",
      "Alone, stationed in a solitary place, self-controlled, free from desire, and not receiving anything from others, the yogi (Practising Dhyanayoga) should unite the mind with Atma. (6.10)",
      "In a clean spot, a firm seat should be made, neither too high nor too low, and it should be covered by cloth, skin, and holy grass one over the other. There, being seated, having made the mind one-pointed, controlling the actions of the mind and the senses, let him practice Dhyana Yoga for self-purification. (6.11-6.12)",
      "Let him firmly hold the body, head and neck erect, and gazing on the tip of his nose, without looking around, let him sit, serene and fearless, established in the vow of celibacy, self-controlled and balanced, thinking of Me as the Supreme goal. (6.13-6.14)",
      "Thus the self-controlled Yogi holding the mind in meditation on the Self, attains peace abiding in me which culminates in the highest bliss of liberation. (6.15)",
      "O Arjuna! Verily, yoga is not for one who eats too much or who does not eat at all, nor for him who sleeps too much or who does not sleep at all. (6.16)",
      "For him who is moderate in food and recreation, moderate in exertion in all actions, moderate in sleep and wakefulness, yoga destroys all pain and suffering (caused by birth and death). (6.17)",
      "When the perfectly controlled mind rests in the Self free from longing for all enjoyments, then one is said to have attained yoga. (6.18)",
      "Just as a lamp in a windless place does not flicker, so the disciplined mind of a yogiremains steady in meditation on the self. (6.19)",
      "Where the mind rests restrained by the practice of yoga, and where the self seeing the Self is delighted in the Self; and where established, the yogi knows that bliss which transcends the senses, which is understandable by the purified intellect only, and from the experience of Self does not even move; possessing which, he does not think any other gain greater than that; in which established he is not shaken even by great sorrow; that should be known by the term yoga, and that yoga which is free from sorrow should be attained by the undesponding and determined mind. (6.20-6.23)",
      "Having abandoned all desires born of the ego-centric will, having restrained the group of senses with mind from all sides, one should attain quietude slowly and slowly by the intellect held firmly. And then, fixing the mind in Atma, he should not think of anything else at all. (6.24-6.25)",
      "Whenever and wherever the restless and unsteady mind wanders, one should bring it back and continually focus it on God. (6.26)",
      "Supreme Bliss comes to the yogi whose mind is completely tranquil and whose passions are quieted, who is free from stain and who has become one with Brahman. (6.27)",
      "Thus the yogi free from evil, practising yoga (union with Atma) always, attains easily the highest bliss resulting from contact with Brahman. (6.28)",
      "The sage harmonised in yoga sees the Self in all beings, and all beings in the Self; he sees the same everywhere. (6.29)",
      "He who sees Me in all beings and all beings in me never becomes lost to me, nor do I become lost to him. (6.30)",
      "The Yogi who worships Me abiding in all beings and who is established in unity abides in me in whatever manner he is acting. (6.31)",
      "He who judges pleasure or pain everywhere, by the same standard as he applies to himself, thatyogiis thought to be the highest. (6.32)",
      "Arjuna said:The system of Yoga that you have described and attainable by equality of mind, O Madhusudana, appears impractical and unattainable to me, due to the restless mind. (6.33)",
      "The mind is very restless, turbulent, strong, and obstinate, O Krishna. It appears to me that it is more difficult to control than the wind. (6.34)",
      "The Lord said:Doubtless, O mighty Arjuna, the mind is restless and hard to control; but by practice and by detachment, O son of Kunti, it can be restrained. (6.35)",
      "Yoga is hard to attain by a man who cannot control his mind, but it can be attained by him who has controlled his mind and who strives earnestly by proper means.This is My opinion. (6.36)",
      "Arjun said:What is the fate of the unsuccessful yogi who begins the path with faith, but who does not endeavor sufficiently, due to unsteady mind, and is unable to reach the goal of Yog in this life? (6.37)",
      "Does not such a person who deviates from Yog get deprived of both material and spiritual success, O mighty-armed Krishna, and perish like a broken cloud with no position in either sphere? (6.38)",
      "You should completely dispel, O Krishna, this doubt of mine; for no one but You can destroy such a doubt. (6.39)",
      "The Lord said: O Pārtha, there is no destruction for him either in this world or the next: no evil, My son, befalls a man who does good. (6.40)",
      "The man who has fallen away from yoga goes to the worlds of the righteous. Having lived there for unnumbered years, he is reborn in the home of the pure and the prosperous. (6.41)",
      "Or he is born into a family of yogis rich in wisdom. Verily, such a birth is hard to gain in this world. (6.42)",
      "There he comes in touch with the knowledge acquired in his former body, O son of the Kurus, and strives still further for perfection. (6.43)",
      "Indeed, they feel drawn toward God, even against their will, on the strength of their past discipline. Such seekers naturally rise above the ritualistic principles of the scriptures. (6.44)",
      "Practising assiduously, the yogi having acquired perfection through many births attains the supreme state (Moksha) purified of all sins. (6.45)",
      "O Arjuna! The yogi is thought to be greater than the ascetic, greater than the learned, and greater than the man of action; therefore be a yogi. (6.46)",

      "With practice, O Parth, when you constantly engage the mind in remembering Me, the Supreme Divine Personality, without deviating, you will certainly attain Me. (8.8)",
      "Who, at the time of leaving the body, by the power of yogic practice, fixes the vital breath in the centre of the brows, and thinks continuously of the Omniscient, the Ancient, the controller of all the worlds, subtler than atom, supporter of all, of inconceivable form, self illumined like the sun, beyond darkness – he attains the self-illumined Paramatma. (8.9-8.10)",
      "I will now briefly describe to you that state which those who know the Vedas call the Imperishable, and into which enter the sannyāsis, self-controlled and freed from attachment, and in desire for which seekers lead the life of continence. (8.11)",
      "He who closes all the doors of the senses, confines the mind within the heart, draws the prāna into the head, and engages in the practice of yoga, uttering Om, the single syllable denoting Brahman, and meditates on Me— he who so departs, leaving the body, attains the Supreme Goal. (8.12-8.13)",
      "O Parth, for those yogis who always think of Me with exclusive devotion, I am easily attainable because of their constant absorption in Me. (8.14)",
      "Having come to Me, these high-souled men are no more subject to rebirth, which is transitory and the abode of pain; for they have reached the highest perfection. (8.15)",
      "O Arjuna! All worlds up to Brahmaloka are subject to return; having attained me there is no re-birth. (8.16)",
      "Those people who know the length of the day of Brahma which ends in a thousand yugas and night which also ends in a thousand yugas, know day and night. (8.17)",
      "At the approach of the day all manifest objects come forth from the unmanifested, and at the approach of the night they merge again into that which is called the unmanifested. (8.18)",
      "The same multitude of beings, coming forth again and again, merge, in spite of themselves, Ο Pārtha, at the approach of the night, and remanifest themselves at the approach of the day. (8.19)",
      "But beyond this unmanifested, there is yet another Unmanifested Eternal Being, who does not perish when all beings perish. (8.20)",
      "This Unmanifested is called the Imperishable; It is said to be the Ultimate Goal, from which those who reach It never come back. That is My Supreme Abode. (8.21)",
      "That Supreme Purusha, in whom all beings abide and by whom the entire universe is pervaded, can be attained, Ο Pārtha, by whole-souled devotion directed to Him alone. (8.22)",
      "Now I will tell you, Ο greatest of the Bhāratas, the time in which the yogis depart never to return, and also the time in which they depart to return. (8.23)",
      "Fire, light, day-time, the bright half of the moon, and the six months of the northward passage of the sun— taking this path, the knowers of Brahman go to Brahman. (8.24)",
      "Smoke, night, the dark half of the moon, and the six months of the southward passage of the sun— taking this path, the yogi reaches the lunar path and thence returns. (8.25)",
      "These two paths— the bright and the dark— are deemed to be the world’s eternal paths. Following the one, a man does not come back, and following the other, he is reborn. (8.26)",
      "No yogi who understands these two paths is ever deluded. Therefore, Ο Arjuna, at all times be steadfast in yoga. (8.27)",
      "The yogi who knows this transcends all the rewards laid down for the study of the Vedas, for sacrifices, for austerities, for making gifts: he reaches the Supreme, Primal Abode. (8.28)"

It is without and within all beings. It is unmoving and also moving. It is incomprehensible because It is subtle. It is far away, and yet It is near. It is indivisible, and yet It is, as it were, divided among beings. That Knowable Brahman is the Sustainer of all beings, and also their Devourer and Generator. The Light even of lights, It is said to be beyond darkness. As knowledge, the object of knowledge, and the goal of knowledge, It is set firm in the hearts of all. (13.15-13.18)",

      "Some by meditation perceive the Self in themselves through the mind, some by devotion to knowledge, and some by devotion to work. (13.25)",

      "Men in whom sattva prevails worship the gods; men in whom rajas prevails worship demigods and demons; and men in whom tamas prevails worship ghosts and disembodied spirits. (17.4)",
      "Those vain and conceited men who, impelled by the force of their lust and attachment, subject themselves to severe austerities not ordained by the scriptures, And, fools that they are, torture all their bodily organs, and Me, too, who dwell within the body— know that they are fiendish in their resolves. (17.5-17.6)",
      "Even the food that is dear to all is of the three kinds. Likewise are the sacrifices, austerities, and gifts. Hear now the distinctions between them. (17.7)",
      "Food that promotes longevity, vitality, strength, health, pleasure, appetite, and that is succulent, oleaginous, substantial, and agreeable, is favoured by people endowed with sattva. (17.8)",
      "Food that is excessively bitter, sour, salty, hot, acrid, dry, and burning is liked by people endowed with rajas. It causes pain, grief, and disease. (17.9)",
      "And food that is ill cooked, tasteless, putrid, stale, unclean, and left over, is favoured by people endowed with tamas. (17.10)",
      "That sacrifice is of the nature of sattva which is offered according to the scriptural rules by those who expect no reward and who firmly believe that it is their duty to sacrifice. (17.11)",
      "But that sacrifice which is performed in expectation of reward and for the sake of ostentation— know that to be of the nature of rajas. (17.12)",
      "And that sacrifice which is not performed according to the scriptural rules, and in which no food is distributed, no hymns are chanted, and no fees paid, and which is devoid of faith, is said to be of the nature of tamas. (17.13)",
      "Worship of the gods, of the twice-born, of teachers, and of the wise; cleanliness, uprightness, continence, and non-violence— these are said to be the austerity of the body. (17.14)",
      "Words that do not give offence and that are truthful, pleasant, and beneficial, and also the regular recitation of the Vedas— these are said to be the austerity of speech. (17.15)",
      "Serenity of mind, gentleness, silence, self-control, and purity of heart— these constitute the austerity of the mind. (17.16)",
      "This threefold austerity practised with supreme faith by steadfast men, without the desire for fruit, is said to be of the nature of sattva. (17.17)",
      "The austerity that is practised in order to gain respect, honour, and reverence, and for ostentation, is said to be of the nature of rajas. Its result is uncertain and transitory. (17.18)",
      "The austerity that is practised with a determination based on foolishness, by means of self-torture, or for the purpose of ruining another is declared to be of the nature of tamas. (17.19)",
      "That gift which is made to one who can make no return, and with the feeling that it is one’s duty to give, and which is given at the right place and time and to a worthy person— such a gift is held to be of the nature of sattva. (17.20)",
      "But that which is given for the sake of recompense or with the expectation of fruit or in a grudging mood is accounted as of the nature of rajas. (17.21)",
      "And the gift that is made without respect or with disdain, at an improper place and time, and to an unworthy person is declared to be of the nature of tamas. (17.22)",
      "“Om Tat Sat”— this has been declared as the threefold designation of Brahman. By means of it were created, at the beginning, the Brāhmins, the Vedas, and the Sacrifices. (17.23)",
      "Therefore the acts of sacrifice, gift, and austerity, enjoined by the scriptures, are always begun by the followers of the Vedas with the utterance of “Om.” (17.24)",
      "And with the utterance of “Tat,” and without seeking any recompense, are the various acts of sacrifice, austerity, and gift performed by those who seek liberation. (17.25)",
      "The word “Sat” is used to denote reality and goodness; and likewise, Ο Pārtha, the word “Sat” is used for an auspicious action. (17.26)",
      "Steadfastness in sacrifice, austerity, and gift is also called “Sat”; and so too is any action connected therewith. (17.27)",
      "Whatever sacrifice or gift is made, whatever austerity is practised, whatever ceremony is observed— it is all called “asat,” “non-existent,” if it is done without faith. It is of no account here or hereafter. (17.28)"

      "Arjuna said: O mighty-armed! I desire to know what sannyasa is and what tyaga is, in essence. Tell me of them separately, O controller of the senses, the slayer of Kesi, Krishna! (18.1)",
      "The Blessed Lord Said : (O Arjuna !) the sages understand Sannyasa, as the renunciation of all desireful actions: the learned declare tyaga as the abandoning of fruits of all works. (18.2)",
      "Some philosophers declare that action should be abandoned as an evil, and others (declare) that acts ofyajna, andTapasshould not be abandoned. (18.3)",
      "O best of the Bharatas, best of men, Arjuna! hear now my final decision about (this problematic) tyaga (the abandoning of Karma): Tyaga has been declared to be three-fold.  (18.4)",
      "Acts of sacrifice, charity, and austerity should not be abandoned; they should be performed indeed; sacrifice, charity, and austerity are purifiers for the thoughtful (who do not desire for fruits). (18.5)",
      "Verily these acts should be performed leaving aside attachment (doership) and the fruits; this is my certain and best opinion. (18.6)",
      "Verily, the renunciation of obligatory action (prescribed by the Sastras) is not proper; the abandoning of the same from delusion is declared to be Tamasic (renunciation). (18.7)",
      "He who abandons obligatory duties from fear of bodily discomfort, as painful (to the body), thus does Tamasic renunciation and obtains not the fruit of renunciation. (18.8)",
      "“This ought to be done as prescribed by the Sastras” – thus knowing, whatsoever work is done without attachment and desire for fruit, that renunciation is regarded as Sattvic. (18.9)",
      "TheSattvic Tyagipossessing purity, intelligence, and with all doubts cut asunder, does not hate any disagreeable work nor is he attached to an agreeable one. (18.10)",
      "Indeed, it is not possible for the embodied being to give up all actions completely; He who renounces the desire for the fruits of action is called (the true) Tyagi (renouncer). (18.11)",
      "The threefold fruits of action, evil, good and mixed accrue to the non-renouncer after death; but never to the renouncer. (18.12)",
      "Learn from Me, O Arjuna! the five courses for the accomplishment of actions, are declared in the Sankhya Sastra at the end of Karmakanda. (18.13)",
      "In the accomplishment of Karma, the five factors are 1. the (seat) body, 2. the doer, 3. the various senses, 4. the various and different functions, and 5. the presiding deity, the fifth. (18.14)",
      "Whatever action a man performs with his body, speech, and mind, whether right ( according to the Sastras ) or the reverse ( opposed to the Sastras ), these five are its causes. (18.15)",
      "This being so, (the five factors being the cause of all Karma) whoever, on account of untrained understanding, thinks the Self as the doer, he, the man of perverted intelligence, does not know the truth about the nature of Atma or the nature of Karma. (18.16)",
      "Who is free from the egoistic notion (“I am the doer”), whose intellect is not tainted (by contact with objects and functions), though having slain all the beings, he does not slay, nor is he bound (by the evil of action). (18.17)",
      "Knowledge, the knowable, and the knower form the threefold impulse to action; the organ, the action and the agent form the threefold basis of action. (18.18)",
      "Knowledge, action and agent are declared to be threefold according to the distinction of Gunas in the Sankhya Sastras; hear them also as declared in the Sastras. (18.19)",
      "In all the beings separated into different categories, that knowledge which sees the one inseparable Reality (Atma), know it to be Sattvic Jnana. (18.20)",
      "That knowledge which sees in all beings various entities (Jivas) of distinct kinds as different from one another, know that knowledge as Rajasic. (18.21)",
      "The knowledge by which, man clings to one thing (body or image) as if it were the whole, without reason and foundation in Truth, and which is trivial, that is declared to be Tamasic (Jnana). (18.22)",
      "Ordained by the Sastras, that action, performed by one not desirous of the fruit, without attachment, free from love and hate, is called Sattvic karma. (18.23)",
      "That action which is done by one longing for desires, or again with egotism, or with much effort, is declared to be Rajasic (Karma). (18.24)",
      "Whatever action is undertaken from delusion, without regard to consequences of loss (of money etc), injury (to himself and others), and (one’s own) ability, is declared Tamasic (Karma). (18.25)",
      "An actor agent who is freed from attachment, non-egotistic, unaffected in success and failure, endued with firmness and enthusiasm, is called Sattvic (Karta). (18.26)",
      "Passionate, longing for the fruits of action, greedy, cruel, impure, moved by elation (when successful) and despair (when unsuccessful)-such an agent is called Rajasic. (18.27)",
      "One who has no self-restraint (concentration of purpose), vulgar, immodest, cheating, deceiving others and ruining their life, lazy, always pessimistic (full of doubts and fears), procrastinating, such an agent is said to be Tamasic. (18.28)",
      "Hear now, O Arjuna! The threefold division of intellect(buddhi)and firmness(dhriti)according to qualities; I will declare it to you fully and distinctly. (18.29)",
      "O Arjuna! That intellect that knows what is righteous action (orkarma marga) and cessation of unrighteous action ( orsannyasa marga), what ought to be done and what ought not to be done, fear and fearlessness, bondage and liberation, isSattvic. (18.30)",
      "O Arjuna! that intellect by which one understands erroneously what is good and evil, what ought to be done and what ought not to be done, is Rajasic. (18.31)",
      "O Arjuna! that intellect, enveloped in darkness, which thinks Adharma as Dharma, and all things perverted is Tamasic. (18.32)",
      "O Arjuna! that unswerving firmness which, by Yoga, holds the functions of the mind, Prana, and bodily organs, is called Sattvic (pure). (18.33)",
      "O Arjuna! that firmness by which, with attachment to the fruits of action, man holds to Dharma, wealth, and desire, is called Rajasic. (18.34)",
      "O Arjuna! that by which a stupid man holds fast to sleep, fear, grief, despair, and also pride and egoism is called Tamasic. (18.35)",
      "O Arjuna! and now hear from Me the three-fold pleasure in which man finds delight by habit, and attains to the end of pain. (18.36)",
      "That pleasure which is like poison at first but in the end is like nectar, born of the purity of one’s own mind of Self-realisation, is declared to be Sattvic. (18.37)",
      "That pleasure arising from contact of the sense organs with the objects, which is like the nectar at first and which in effect is like poison, is declared to beRajasic. (18.38)",
      "That pleasure that arises from sleep, idleness, and error causes delusion during the enjoyment and in the sequel, is said to be Tamasic. (18.39)",
      "There is no being, either on the earth or in Heaven among the Devas, who is freed from the three qualities (Gunas) arising from Prakriti (Maya). (18.40)",
      "Arjuna! works for the different castes (Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaisyas and Sudras) are variously determined according to their nature born of Prakriti. (18.41)",
      "Control of the internal and external organs, austerity, purity, forgiveness, integrity, knowledge of the Sastras, direct experience of the truth, faith in God, Guru and the Scriptures are the duties of the Brahmins born of their own nature. (18.42)",
      "Prowess, splendor (greatness), firmness, dexterity, not running away in battle, magnanimity, lordship (commanding and ruling power)-these are the functions of Kshatriyas born of their nature. (18.43)",
      "Agriculture, cattle-rearing, and trade are the duties of the Vysyas, born of their nature; action consisting of service is the duty of the Sudras. (18.44)",
      "By fulfilling their duties, born of their innate qualities, human beings can attain perfection. Now hear from me how one can become perfect by discharging one’s prescribed duties. (18.45)",
      "By performing one’s natural occupation, one worships the Creator from whom all living entities have come into being, and by whom the whole universe is pervaded. By such performance of work, a person easily attains perfection. (18.46)",
      "Better is one’s own duty though destitute of merits or incomplete than the duty of another well performed; the man who performs action ordained by his own nature does not incur sin. (18.47)",
      "O Arjuna! One should not abandon the duty to which he is born, though it is attended with evil; all undertakings are indeed enveloped by evil, like fire by smoke. (18.48)",
      "He whose intellect is unattached, who has subdued his self, whose desires are quelled, by renunciation attains the supreme actionless state of Atma. (18.49)",
      "O Arjuna! learn from Me in brief how reaching perfection in action, man attains Brahman, the consummation of supreme knowledge. (18.50)",
      "Endowed with a pure understanding, restraining the self with firmness, turning away from sound and other sense-objects, and abandoning love and hatred; Dwelling in solitude, eating but little, controlling the speech, body, and mind, ever engaged in meditation and concentration, and cultivating freedom from passion; Forsaking conceit and power, pride and lust, wrath and possessions, tranquil in heart, and free from ego— he becomes worthy of becoming one with Brahman. (18.51-18.53)",
      "Becoming Brahman, serene-minded, neither grieving nor desiring, the same to all beings, (he) obtain supreme devotion to Me. (18.54)",
      "By devotion he knows Me in essence, what I am and who I am; then having known Me in truth, he forthwith enters into Me. (18.55)",
      "Performing all actions continually, he who takes refuge in Me only obtains the indestructible state of Moksha by My grace. (18.56)",
      "Mentally surrendering all actions to Me, having Me as the highest goal, resorting to Buddhiyoga, fix your mind ever on Me. (18.57)",
      "Fixing your mind on Me, by My grace, you will overcome all obstacles; but if from egotism, you do not take My instruction, you will perish. (18.58)",
      "If prompted by egoism you think ‘I will not fight’, vain is your resolve. Your nature will compel you to fight. (18.59)",
      "O Arjuna! bound by your own Karma, born of your own nature, that which in a deluded state you do not wish to do, even that you will do helplessly. (18.60)",
      "O Arjuna! the Lord dwells in the hearts of all beings, causing all beings to revolve like puppets by His illusive power (Maya). (18.61)",
      "O Arjuna! With your whole being, take refuge in the Lord; by His grace, you will obtain supreme peace and the eternal abode (i.e.) liberation.(18.62)",
      "Thus, I have explained to you this knowledge that is more secret than all secrets. Ponder over it deeply, and then do as you wish. (18.63)",
      "(O Arjuna !) Listen again to My supreme word, the profoundest of all. You are dear to me and faithful. Therefore I shall tell you what is for your good (18.64)",
      "Fix your mind on Me; be devoted to Me; sacrifice to me; prostrate before me; so shall you come to me only. This is My pledge to you, for you are dear to me. (18.65)",
      "Having abandoned all duties (Dharmas) take refuge in Me alone. I will liberate you from all sins. Do not grieve. (18.66)",
      "This is never to be spoken by you to one who is devoid of austerity, nor to one who is not devoted, nor to one who does not do service, nor to one who speaks ill of me. (18.67)",
      "He who with supreme devotion in me will teach this profound philosophy to my devotees shall doubtless come to me alone. (18.68)",
      "There is none among men who can do anything more pleasing to Me than he; nor shall there be another on earth dearer to Me than he. (18.69)",
      "And he who shall study this sacred dialogue of ours, by him I shall have been worshipped by Jnana yajna; this is my conviction. (18.70)",
      "And the man who hears this, full of faith and free from malice, even he shall attain the happy worlds of the righteous, freed from all evil. (18.71)",
      "Has this been heard by you O Partha, with a concentrated mind? Has the delusion of your ignorance been destroyed O Arjuna? (18.72)",
      "Arjuna said: My delusion is destroyed, I have regained my memory through your grace, ‘O Krishna! I stand firm, free from doubt; I will act according to your word. (18.73)",
      "Sanjaya said:- Thus have I heard this wonderful dialogue between Lord Krishna and high-souled Arjuna, causing my hair to stand on end. (18.74)",
      "Through the grace of Vyasa, I have heard this supreme and most secret Yoga direct from Krishna, the Lord of Yoga, Himself declaring it. (18.75)",
      "O King! as I recall again and again this wonderful and holy dialogue between Krishna and Arjuna, I rejoice again and again. (18.76)",
      "O King! As often as I recall that most wonderful form of the Lord, great is my astonishment, and I rejoice again and again. (18.77)",
      "Wherever is Krishna, the Lord of Yoga, wherever is Partha, the wielder of the bow, there are prosperity victory, happiness, and righteousness, such is my conviction. (18.78)"
