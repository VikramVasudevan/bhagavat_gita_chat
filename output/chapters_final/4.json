      "The Lord at first taught the secret of `nishkama karma’ to the Sun, and through him, the Emperor – saints learned it. By the power of this Yoga, the mind is purified and the Self is realised. All those who practised this Yoga became sages and attained freedom and perfection. Though they may belong to different strata of society, rich or poor, all of them attained the highest reward of truth and perfection.",
      "Imperishable:The yoga is imperishable, because as long as the universe lasts, work in some form or other has to be done, and desireless work is the direct road leading to Moksha. At all times, under all circumstances, desireless action is the law of spiritual life, and out of it arises knowledge of the Self. So the Yoga is imperishable. As long as mankind exists, this law holds good as the direct path to emancipation.",

      "O Arjuna! The royal sages know this (yoga) which was handed down in regular succession from generation to generation. But by long lapse of time, this Yoga was lost to the world."
    ],
    "commentary": [
      "Royal sages -Kings who knew Brahmavidya are called royal sages. They are Jnanis as well as rulers, who possessed royalty and wisdom together. In the earliest times, several Kings and emperors were endowed with Self-Knowledge. The term `Rishi’ is a title. Anyone can acquire it. Even an ordinary man becomes a `Rishi’ when he comes to possess Atma vidya. So the man who conquers the senses and mind, who is able to practise nishkama karma, and who has attained a glimpse of the Supreme Self is a Rishi.",
      "We have to understand that in former ages, Kings were the real possessors of Brahma vidya. This proves that worldly life is not in any way a barrier to Atma vidya. Let us imagine the life of a King in former times. He was the supreme power of the state, and he was responsible for the administration of the whole kingdom. How many cares and anxieties he must have had in discharging his royal duties. And yet, it was the king who acquired and possessed the highest wisdom. The practical application of Vedanta to actual life was the contribution of these great monarchs to the world. Let us hear the words of Swami Vivekananda on this point. “In various Upanishads, we find that this Vedanta philosophy is not the outcome of meditation in the forests only but that the very best parts of it were thought out by brains which were busiest in the everyday affairs of life. We cannot conceive any man busier than an absolute monarch, a man ruling over millions of people and yet, some of these rulers were deep thinkers.” Arjuna comes of a noble family of royal sages. So it would not be difficult for him to tread the path of the ancient kings who were adept both in worldly matters and spiritual knowledge.",
      "It does not mean that others are not qualified for this Yoga. In fact, the Lord’s message is for people who are engaged in the different avocations of life, like teachers, politicians, administrators, agriculturists or shop-keepers, etc. Very often we hear people brushing aside anything of spiritual knowledge as an obstacle to their worldly activities, which they say are necessary for the maintenance of this life. This verse condemns such an apathetic attitude to the spiritual life because it is pointed out that monarchs have practised this Yoga with great advantage to their spiritual and practical life.",
      "Was lost:This does not mean that Karma Yoga as a spiritual path was completely destroyed. Some incidents might have caused neglect of this Yoga for the time being. But it cannot be destroyed as it is imperishable – Avyayam. Just as the Lord is eternal, even so, the Dharma established by Him is eternal."

      "The spiritual path of Karma Yoga is not a new invention. It is an ancient path. But owing to the change of times, it was covered up and neglected for some time. But it is imperishable. When spiritual Dharma suffers decline, the Lord incarnates Himself to re-establish it. Great spiritual men like Sankara and others come into the world to reclaim the declining Dharma and re-establish it in the world. This same ancient knowledge is now taught to Arjuna by Lord Krishna.",
      "Why should the Lord choose Arjuna only to be the recipient of this knowledge? This is answered by this verse. Arjuna was a devotee and a friend of the Lord. Therefore this supreme secret was revealed to him. Whoever loves the Lord is His friend and devotee. On him, the Lord bestows supreme knowledge.",
      "So one should acquire the faith and devotion of Arjuna, and to such a man the Lord Himself offers all the secrets of spiritual knowledge. The Lord has no attachment of friend or foe. Whoever loves Him receives His love and compassion. Arjuna’s faith in the Lord has won for him a place in the heart of Krishna, and hence the divine message was offered to him.",
      "Best secret:The spiritual path of `nishkama karma’ is not only a secret but a royal path to knowledge.

      "In the Rajasuya Yaga, Arjuna has already come to know that Krishna is the eternal Lord of the Universe, though he is apparently the son of Devaki and Vasudeva. Still, it is quite possible that the supreme secret of the Lord’s incarnation might have appeared as a mystery to Arjuna, and he desired that the Lord Himself should unravel the mystery. Arjuna’s doubt is the doubt of all ordinary human beings, and so the Lord’s answer is intended to enlighten mankind about the mystery of His incarnation in the world.",
      "Indeed, Lord Krishna is not a material form composed of the five elements as is the body of a human being. He is the eternal all-pervading Supreme Being of the Universe. This very truth is declared by the Lord in his reply to Arjuna. This universe and all that is in it can be looked at from three planes of vision. As soon as one sees a material object, man or animal or plant or stone or anything else, he takes in the object through the visual sense organ – the form, the colour, shape and complexion and other aspects of its external appearance. When he rises to the mental plane, he considers the character, qualities and nature of the object which could be understood only by the mind. When he rises higher still, he finds that all this universe with all that exists in it is nothing but the soul, the Atma – the supreme Sacchidananda. This is the spiritual plane of vision. The former two are relative truths. The last is the absolute Truth. To distinguish this relative from the Absolute, and hold on to the Absolute is the aim of spiritual Sadhana.",
      "“This yoga I taught in ancient times [to Vivasvan; Vivasvan taught it to Manu]. … Thus it was that the knowledge descended from one thing to another. But in time this great yoga was destroyed. That is why I am telling it to you again today.” Then Arjuna asks, “Why do you speak thus? You are a man born only the other day, and [Vivasvan was born long before you]. What do you mean that you taught him?”[Source]"

Iswara incarnates himself by controlling Maya, for the purpose of establishing Dharma in the world. But the Jiva is born again and again to work out his own karma, under the power and control of Maya. Since the Lord is the Lord of Maya, He knows all His incarnations from the beginning of creation, whereas the Jiva forgets them by the deluding power of Maya.",
      "On account of Avidya, man’s knowledge is confined to the present life only. In truth, every man has passed through myriads of births. He had parents, wives and children, friends and enemies, wealth and prosperity, good and bad, during thousands of former births. But he has no knowledge of them now. If man fails to cut the bonds of karma by knowledge of Atma, he has still to pass through innumerable births. By virtue of the ‘good that he has done, he has now acquired the human birth, endowed with reason and discrimination, and not the birth of a worm or reptile, bird or beast. Having this great good fortune if still he indulges in sense pleasures and gets lost in the meshes of karma, he is indeed an unfortunate being.",

      "Let people not forget that they have had the same pleasures and pains during myriads of births, and when they realise this, they lose all taste and resort for worldly attachments and pleasures.

She stayed in that small town for three days and every morning and evening she would visit the temple and perform worship with flowers,chandan(sandal) and vilva leaves.

      "One day I (Swami Akhandananda) visited the Master and had prasad at the temple. A group of lay devotees came after his noon rest, and I spread a mat for them on the floor. One of them asked the Master, “Sir, is it good that these young boys come to you to embrace the monastic life, disregarding the householder’s life?” The Master replied:“Look, you only see their present life, and not their previous lives in which they passed through these other stages.For instance, a man has four sons. One of them, having grown up, says: ‘I shall not put oil on my body or eat fish. I shall eat only self-cooked vegetarian food.’ The parents try to dissuade him from these habits and even threaten him, but the boy will not give up the path of renunciation. Yet the other three sons are set on enjoyment and swallow whatever they get. Look, it is because of the preponderance of sattva that this boy wants to renounce everything before he reaches manhood.” (Source: God Lived with Them)",
      "As other Incarnations of God have had someone to witness or collect their teachings, perhaps M. was this same great soul born again for that purpose. Sri Ramakrishna recognized M.’s value at first sight, and the following comments he made about M. indicate that M. was not an ordinary person: “I recognized you on hearing you read the Chaitanya Bhagavat. You are my own. The same substance, like father and son. . . . Before you came here, you didn’t know who you were. Now you will know.” “Once [in a vision] I saw Gauranga and his devotees singing kirtan in the Panchavati. I think I saw Balaram there and you too.” “Yes,I know everything: what your Ideal is, who you are, your inside and outside, the events of your past lives, and your future.” “I can see from the signs of your eyes, brows, and face that you are a yogi. You look like a yogi who has just left his seat of meditation.” (Source: They Lived with God)",
      "On 15 July 1885, Balaram asked the Master, “Sir, how was it possible for Purna to know all of a sudden that the world is illusory?” Sri Ramakrishna replied: “He has inherited that knowledge from his previous births. In his past lives he practised many disciplines. It is the body alone that is small or grows big, and not the Atman. Do you know what these youngsters are like? They are like certain plants that grow fruit first and then flowers. These devotees first of all have the vision of God; next they hear about His glories and attributes; and at last they are united with Him.” (Source: They Lived with God)",
      "“Both you and I have passed through many births; you know them not, I know them all.”[Source]",
      "A boy named Vishnu, living in Ariadaha, had recently committed suicide by cutting his throat with a razor. The talk turned to him.MASTER:“I felt very badly when I heard of the boy’s passing away. He was a pupil in a school and he used to come here. He would often say to me that he couldn’t enjoy worldly life. He had lived with some relatives in the western provinces and at that time used to meditate in solitude, in the meadows, hills, and forests. He told me he had visions of many divine forms.“Perhaps this was his last birth. He must have finished most of his duties in his previous birth. The little that had been left undone was perhaps finished in this one.(BG 7.19)“One must admit the existence of tendencies inherited from previous births. There is a story about a man who practised the sava-sadhana. (A religious practice prescribed by the Tantra, in which the aspirant uses a sava, or corpse, as his seat for meditation.) He worshipped the Divine Mother in a deep forest. First he saw many terrible visions. Finally a tiger attacked and killed him. Another man, happening to pass and seeing the approach of the tiger, had climbed a tree. Afterwards he got down and found all the arrangements for worship at hand. He performed some purifying ceremonies and seated himself on the corpse. No sooner had he done a little japa than the Divine Mother appeared before him and said: ‘My child, I am very much pleased with you. Accept a boon from Me.’ He bowed low at the Lotus Feet of the Goddess and said: ‘May I ask You one question, Mother? I am speechless with amazement at Your action. The other man worked so hard to get the ingredients for Your worship and tried to propitiate You for such a long time, but You didn’t condescend to show him Your favour. And I, who don’t know anything of worship, who have done nothing, who have neither devotion nor knowledge nor love, and who haven’t practised any austerities, am receiving so much of Your grace.’ The Divine Mother said with a laugh;‘My child, you don’t remember your previous births. For many births you tried to propitiate Me through austerities. As a result of those austerities all these things have come to hand, and you have been blessed with My vision. Now ask Me your boon.’“",
      "A DEVOTEE:“I am frightened to hear of the suicide.”MASTER:“Suicide is a heinous sin, undoubtedly. A man who kills himself must return again and again to this world and suffer its agony.“But I don’t call it suicide if a person leaves his body after having the vision of God. There is no harm in giving up one’s body that way. After attaining Knowledge some people give up their bodies. After the gold image has been cast in the clay mould, you may either preserve the mould or break it. (Source:Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna)",

He said to M:, “There is great significance in this.” (The stroking of his feet) Placing his hand on his heart, the Master said, “If there is anything here, then through this service the ignorance and illusion of the devotees will be completely destroyed.”Suddenly Sri Ramakrishna became serious, as if about to reveal a secret.MASTER (to M.):“There is no outsider here. The other day, when Harish was with me, I saw Satchidananda come out of this sheath. (Sri Ramakrishna’s body.) It said‘I incarnate Myself in every age.’I thought that I myself was saying these words out of mere fancy. I kept quiet and watched.

Some wondered whether God Himself was seated before them in the form of Sri Ramakrishna. The Master paused a moment. Then he said, addressing M., “I saw that it is the fullest manifestation of Satchidananda; but this time the Divine Power is manifested through the glory of sattva.”The devotees sat spellbound.

    "commentary": [
      "The Lord Himself protects the good and the righteous. By obeying the laws of Dharma, man acquires the right of protection by the Lord, whose protecting hand never fails at any time. Thus the Lord’s promise to the righteous is the only protection that a good man seeks in his perilous life. He escapes from the bonds of samsara easily. He crosses the ocean of ignorance quickly. He attains freedom. One should understand that there are internal enemies of man in the spiritual path and these foes in the heart of man are all destroyed by the Lord’s grace. So for those devotees who have faith in the Lord, there is no fear either from the external or internal enemies, whoever they are and whatever power they may wield.",
      "Besides protecting the good, the destruction of the wicked is the second vow of the Lord. So the spiritual seeker should be careful and vigilant. He should be far away from evil and evil men. He should tread the path of Dharma, for then the Lord is pleased, and when the Lord is pleased, nothing is impossible for them.",
      "The third vow of the Lord is establishing Dharma in the world. Dharma is the life breath of the Lord. It is the principle of human existence. It is the sustaining power of the whole universe. Any deviation from the law will immediately bring down the mighty structure of the universe. Hence the Lord has to manifest Himself to save the world from self-destruction by the force of evil.",
      "When we study the history of the different incarnations of God, we find that He manifests Himself for any one or two or all the purposes mentioned above. The incarnation of Narasimha (Lion-man) came to eliminate Hiranya Kasipu and protect the devotee Prahlada. The incarnation of Sri Rama came to fulfill all the three vows of the Lord. He protected the good, destroyed the wicked Rakshasas, and established Dharma by holding sovereignty over the earth for several years.",
      "The word `Sadhu’ is not limited to sanyasis only. It refers to all who are righteous whatever may be their caste or position or occupation.",
      "In every age:This does not mean that the Lord appears only once in a yuga (i.e.) cycle of time. It means that the Lord is ready to appear whenever there is a need and wherever the necessity arises. The Lord responds to the call of the devotees at all times and under all circumstances.",
      "The reader has to notice the special emphasis laid on the three keywords in the verse.‘Paritranaya’is used instead of`tranaya’;`vinasaya’is used instead of`nasaya’;`samsthapanarthaya’is used instead of`sthapanarthaya’. This shows the special significance attached to every one of the vows uttered by the Lord.",
      "One may doubt how the Lord who is the embodiment of all love and compassion could punish the wicked who are also His children. To punish the wicked is not an act of hatred but a measure of the Lord’s mercy to bring them into the fold of the righteous. Besides this, unless evil is removed, it spreads like wildfire and consumes the entire humanity. Evil is like cancer in the human organism. If it is not removed by an operation, it will poison the whole system and destroys the entire man. So it is necessary that the evil-doers should be punished to save mankind from total corruption and death.",
      "In India they have the same idea of the Incarnations of God. One of their great Incarnations, Krishna, whose grand sermon, the Bhagavad Gita, some of you might have read, says, “Though I am unborn, of changeless nature, and Lord of beings, yet subjugating My Prakriti, I come into being by My own Maya. Whenever virtue subsides and immorality prevails, then I body Myself forth. For the protection of the good, for the destruction of the wicked, and for the establishment of dharma, I come into being, in every age.” Whenever the world goes down, the Lord comes to help it forward; and so He does from time to time and place to place.[Source]",
      "A Hindu philosopher would say: These are the great souls; they are already free. And though free, they refuse to accept their liberation while the whole world is suffering. They come again and again, take a human embodiment and help mankind. They know from their childhood what they are and what they come for. … They do not come through bondage like we do. … They come out of their own free will, and cannot help having tremendous spiritual power. We cannot resist it. The vast mass of mankind is dragged into the whirlpool of spirituality, and the vibration goes on and on because one of these [great souls] gives a push. So it continues until all mankind is liberated and the play of this planet is finished.[Source]",
      "Whenever virtue subsides and wickedness prevails, I come to help mankind. For the salvation of the good, for the destruction of wickedness, for the establishment of spirituality I come from time to time.[Source]",
      "“Whenever virtue subsides and immorality abounds, I take human form. In every age I come for the salvation of the good, for the destruction of the wicked, for the establishment of spirituality.”[Source]",
      "God understands human failings and becomes man to do good to humanity: “Whenever virtue subsides and wickedness prevails, I manifest Myself. To establish virtue, to destroy evil, to save the good I come fromyuga(age) toyuga.”[Source]",
      "God understands human failings and becomes a man to do good to humanity. “Whenever virtue subsides and immorality prevails, then I come to help mankind”, says Krishna.[Source]",
      "“Whenever virtue subsides and vice prevails, I come down to help mankind,” declares Krishna, in theBhagavad Gita. Whenever this world of ours, on account of growth, on account of added circumstances, requires a new adjustment, a wave of power comes; and as man is acting on two planes, the spiritual and the material, waves of adjustment come on both planes.[Source]",
      "“Whenever virtue subsides, and wickedness raises its head, I manifest Myself to restore the glory of religion” — are the words, O noble Prince,(*)of the Eternal One in the holy Gita, striking the keynote of the pulsating ebb and flow of the spiritual energy in the universe. These changes are manifesting themselves again and again in rhythms peculiar to themselves, and like every other tremendous change, though affecting, more or less, every particle within their sphere of action, they show their effects more intensely upon those particles which are naturally susceptible to their power.[Source]",
      "Religious knowledge became complete whenTat Twam Asi(Thou art That) was discovered, and that was in the Vedas. What remained was the guidance of people from time to time according to different times and places, according to different circumstances and environments; people had to be guided along the old, old path, and for this these great teachers came, these great sages. Nothing can bear out more clearly this position than the celebrated saying of Shri Krishna in the Gita: “Whenever virtue subsides and irreligion prevails, I create Myself for the protection of the good; for the destruction of all immorality I am coming from time to time.” This is the idea in India.[Source]",
      "Our prophet says that whenever evil and immortality prevail on earth, He will come down and support His children; and this He is doing from time to time and from place to place. And whenever on earth you see an extraordinary holy man trying to uplift humanity, know that He is in him.[Source]",
      "Since the dawn of history, no missionary went out of India to propagate the Hindu doctrines and dogmas; but now a wonderful change is coming over us. Shri Bhagavan Krishna says, “Whenever virtue subsides and immorality prevails, then I come again and again to help the world.” Religious researches disclose to us the fact that there is not a country possessing a good ethical code but has borrowed something of it from us, and there is not one religion possessing good ideas of the immortality of the soul but has derived it directly or indirectly from us.[Source]",
      "We read in the history of the world about prophets and their lives, and these come down to us through centuries of writings and workings by their disciples. Through thousands of years of chiselling and modelling, the lives of the great prophets of yore come down to us; and yet, in my opinion, not one stands so high in brilliance as that life which I saw with my own eyes, under whose shadow I have lived, at whose feet I have learnt everything — the life of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. Ay, friends, you all know the celebrated saying of the Gita: “Whenever, O descendant of Bharata, there is decline of dharma, and rise ofadharma, then I body Myself forth. For the protection of the good, for the destruction of the wicked, and for the establishment of dharma I come into being in every age.”[Source]",
      "There are a great many similarities in the teaching of theNew Testamentand the Gita. The human thought goes the same way. … I will find you the answer in the words of Krishna himself: “Whenever virtue subsides and irreligion prevails, I come down. Again and again I come. Therefore, whenever thou seest a great soul struggling to uplift mankind, know that I am come, and worship.”[Source]",
      "The central figure of the Gita is Krishna. As you worship Jesus of Nazareth as God come down as man, so the Hindus worship many Incarnations of God. They believe in not one or two only, but in many, who have come down from time to time, according to the needs of the world, for the preservation of dharma and destruction of wickedness. Each sect has one, and Krishna is one of them.[Source]",
      "Life is short, but the soul is immortal and eternal, and one thing being certain, death, let us therefore take up a great ideal and give up our whole life to it. Let this be our determination, and may He, the Lord, who “comes again and again for the salvation of His own people”, to quote from our scriptures — may the great Krishna bless us and lead us all to the fulfilment of our aims![Source]",

    "commentary": [
      "The essence of the Upanishadic declaration “Brahmavit Brahmaiva bhavati” is restated in this verse. One who knows Brahman becomes that. Between knowing and becoming, there is no distinction in Brahmavidya. It is different in the objective world; there the knower and the known are different. But in the realm of the Self, knowing and becoming are one. In other words, only he who knows Him becomes Brahman. But what is this knowing of Brahman? It is certainly not an intellectual conclusion, drawn by logic and argument from a study of the Sastras. One may be convinced by the logical argument that Brahman alone is real, and yet he may be far far away from realising Him. This is not knowledge of Brahman. Knowing Brahman means the direct experience of Atma which is beyond the body, senses mind and intellect. This is to know Brahman in the essence (Tattatah).",
      "In this verse, the Lord states that he who knows the essential principle of His divine birth and action enters Him and has no further birth. By deep mediation and ecstasy of devotion, man becomes one with the Lord.To know the nature of the Lord isSadhana, and to become one with Him isSadhya. The first is practice the second is the goal.One must know HimTattvatah(i.e) by impersonal realisation according to the injunctions of the Sastras.",
      "Divine:The life and work of the Lord are divine and they cannot be compared with those of mortal beings. The Lord is the master of Maya, whereas all mortals are enslaved by Maya. Their birth and action are controlled by Maya. On the other hand, the Lord controls Maya and acts in His own state of supreme perfection. The man who is able to understand the mystery unites himself with the Lord and has no need to go through the cycle of birth and death. It shows that birthlessness is not a negative state of emptiness or nothingness, but a positive state of perfection and blessedness.The doubt that the ultimate state can only be a state of nothingness is common to many people. Being habituated to confusing life with the operations of the body, senses, and mind, man is not able to conceive a state beyond these planes. But it is made clear here that unity with the Lord comprehends life at all levels and in all planes of existence and is infinitely more beyond.",
      "Having abandoned the body:One should note that abandoning the body is not a precondition of realisation. Even when the physical body remains, if a man comes to know by meditation and devotion the ultimate mystery of the Lord, he becomes free from Samsara, the cycle of birth and death. What is here mentioned is only to affirm that there is no more birth for the knower of the Lord.",

      "MASTER (to Mahima):“For a long time I have wanted to tell you my spiritual experiences, but I could not. I feel like telling you today.“You say that by mere sadhana one can attain a state of mind like mine. But it is not so. There is something special here [referring to himself].”Rakhal, M., and the others became eager to hear what the Master was going to say.MASTER:“God talked to me. It was not merely His vision. Yes, He talked to me. Under the banyan-tree I saw Him coming from the Ganges. Then we laughed so much! By way of playing with me He cracked my fingers. Then He talked. Yes, He talked to me.“For three days I wept continously. And He revealed to me what is in the Vedas, the Puranas, the Tantras, and the other scriptures.“One day He showed me the maya of Mahamaya. A small light inside a room began to grow, and at last it enveloped the whole universe.“Further, He revealed to me a huge reservoir of water covered with green scum. The wind moved a little of the scum and immediately the water became visible; but in the twinkling of an eye, scum from all sides came dancing in and again covered the water. He revealed to me that the water was like Satchidananda, and the scum like maya. On account of maya, Satchidananda is not seen. Though now and then one may get a glimpse of It, again maya covers It.“God reveals the nature of the devotees to me before they arrive. I saw Chaitanya’s party singing and dancing near the Panchavati, between the banyan-tree and the bakul-tree. I noticed Balaram there. If it weren’t for him, who would there be to supply me with sugar candy and such things? (Pointing to M.) And I saw him too.“I had seen Keshab before I actually met him — I had seen him and his party in my samadhi. In front of me sat a roomful of men. Keshab looked like a peacock sitting with its tail spread out. The tail meant his followers. I saw a red gem on Keshab’s head. That indicated his rajas. He said to his disciples, ‘Please listen to what he [meaning the Master] is saying.’ I said to the Divine Mother: ‘Mother, these people hold the views of “Englishmen”. Why should I talk to them?’ Then the Mother explained to me that it would be like this in the Kaliyuga.“Keshab and his followers got from here [meaning himself] the names of Hari and the Divine Mother. That is why the Divine Mother took Vijay away from Keshab’s party. But Vijay did not join the Adi Samaj. (A sect of the Brahmo Samaj.)(Pointing to himself) “There must be something special here. Long ago a young man named Gopal Sen used to visit me. He who dwells in me placed His foot on Gopal’s chest. Gopal said in an ecstatic mood: ‘You will have to wait here a long time. I cannot live any more with worldly people.’ He took leave of me. Afterwards I heard that he was dead. Perhaps he was born as Nityagopal.“I have had many amazing visions. I had a vision of the Indivisible Satchidananda. Inside It I saw two groups with a fence between them. On one side were Kedar, Chuni, and other devotees who believe in the Personal God. On the other side was a luminous space like a heap of red brick-dust. Inside it was seated Narendra immersed in samadhi. Seeing him absorbed in meditation, I called aloud, ‘Oh, Narendra!’ He opened his eyes a little. I came to realise that he had been born, in another form, in Simla (The section of Calcutta in which Narendra was born.) in a kayastha family. At once I said to the Divine Mother, ‘Mother, entangle him in maya; otherwise he will give up his body in samadhi.’ Kedar, a believer in the Personal God, peeped in and ran away with a shudder.“Therefore I feel that it is the Divine Mother Herself who dwells in this body and plays with the devotees. When I first had my exalted state of mind, my body would radiate light. My chest was always flushed. Then I said to the Divine Mother: ‘Mother, do not reveal Thyself outwardly. Please go inside.’ That is why my complexion is so dull now. If my body were still luminous, people would have tormented me; a crowd would always have thronged here. Now there is no outer manifestation. That keeps weeds away. Only genuine devotees will remain with me now. Do you know why I have this illness? It has the same significance. Those whose devotion to me has a selfish motive behind it will run away at the sight of my illness.“I cherished a desire. I said to the Mother, ‘O Mother, I shall be the king of the devotees.’“Again, this thought arose in my mind: ‘He who sincerely prays to God will certainly come here. He must.’ You see, that is what is happening now. Only people of that kind come.“My parents knew who dwells inside this body. Father had a dream at Gaya. In that dream Raghuvir said to him, ‘I shall be born as your son.’“God alone dwells inside this body. Such renunciation of ‘woman and gold’! Could I have accomplished that myself? I have never enjoyed a woman, even in a dream.“Nangta instructed me in Vedanta. In three days I went into samadhi. At the sight of my samadhi under the madhavi vine, he was quite taken aback and exclaimed, ‘Ah! What is this?’ Then he came to know who resides in this body. He said to me, ‘Please let me go.’ At these words of Totapuri, I went into an ecstatic mood and said, You cannot go till I realise the Truth of Vedanta.’“Day and night I lived with him. We talked only Vedanta. The Brahmani used to say to me: ‘Don’t listen to Vedanta. It will injure your devotion to God.’“I said to the Divine Mother: ‘Mother, please get me a rich man. If You don’t, how shall I be able to protect this body? How shall I be able to keep the sadhus and devotees, near me?’ That is why Mathur Babu provided for my needs for fourteen years. ……“I have practised all kinds of sadhana: jnanayoga, karmayoga, and bhaktiyoga. I have even gone through the exercises of hathayoga to increase longevity. There is another Person dwelling in this body. Otherwise, after attaining samadhi, how could I live with the devotees and enjoy the love of God? Koar Singh used to say to me: ‘I have never before seen a person who has returned from the plane of samadhi. You are none other than Nanak.’…….But did Mahimacharan understand the import of these words? Even after hearing them, he said to the Master, “These things have happened to you on account of your meritorious actions in your past births.” Mahima still thought that Sri Ramakrishna was a sadhu or a devotee of God. The Master nodded assent to Mahima’s words and said: “Yes, the result of past actions. God is like an aristocrat who has many mansions. Here [referring to himself] is one of His drawing-rooms. The bhakta is God’s drawing-room.” (Source:Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna)",

How can we give up all desires? That is impossible.’ ‘Then you have to suffer,’ I said. ‘There is only one way—giving up desires.

      "Sometimes Narendra told the devotees wonderful stories of how the Master’s sadhana had originated from his deep passion for God, and he charmed them with descriptions of the Master’s glory. Quoting from The Imitation of Christ [by Thomas à Kempis], Narendra said: “‘The life of anybody who truly loves the Lord will be perfectly moulded in His pattern.’ Therefore, whether we truly love the Master or not will be proven by this.” He reminded the devotees of the Master’s teaching: “First tie the knowledge of nonduality in a corner of your cloth, then do as you please.” Narendra then explained to them that every one of the Master’s ecstatic moods arose from that nondual knowledge; so they should strive to attain that knowledge first.

      "In this Discourse, the Lord describes the merits of Jnana in different ways, such asTapas, Yajna, Agni, Nauka and Khadga. Here Jnana is described as tapas, a penance of wonderful merit because it cleanses all accumulated sins of previous births and all the impurities of inherited instincts, impulses and tendencies. Such men who are purified by this penance are mentioned as purified (Putah). What are the marks of this Jnana tapas? Freedom from desire, fear and hatred, intense devotion and absorption in the Lord, seeking ultimate refuge in Him, – these are the aspects of Jnana tapas. What is its effect? Attaining the Lord, Self-realisation through purity is the reward.",
      "Free from desire, fear and hatred:Attachment to worldly objects, fear and hatred, form the triple-headed monster who should be killed and destroyed. Is it an easy task? How to destroy them? The Lord points the way. He says, ‘think of me, be absolved in me, take refuge in me.’ That is the way to conquer the enemy. As man acquires greater and greater firmness in Jnana, these obstacles are gradually cleared from the mind, and that very moment when the mind is destroyed, the supreme Self is realised. When the mind ceases to exist, Self is realised, and when Self is realised, mind ceases to exist. So one should practice the two aspects of Jnana simultaneously.",
      "Many:The Lord produces direct evidence by showing that many aspirants have attained Him by Jnana tapas, having purified their minds. What has been possible in the past should be possible in the present and the future. The aspirants should therefore follow this spiritual sadhana and attain the goal.

    "commentary": [
      "The Lord declares here that the reward for men who worship Him would be strictly in relation to the aim and object of their worship. The purpose of devotion, its method and manner, and its intensity would determine the nature of the reward. God is like the wish-yielding plant of Paradise. What man wishes to obtain, that the Lord gives. The man who is suffering from bodily pain prays to be relieved of that pain, and the pain is relieved. The poor man wishes for wealth and prosperity, and God gives him these worldly benefits. The devotee yearns for the devotion and he gets that. The Jnani seeks for liberation and he attains Moksha. This is to say that different types of persons share the grace of God in different ways each according to his own samskaras. If men seek perishable worldly things, they get only those things and not Moksha. When we approach God, we should clearly know what we should seek. It would be absurd for a man to approach an Emperor and ask for a few vegetables. How foolish then would it be to approach God for worldly pleasures and enjoyments, instead of true knowledge and devotion! The wind of God’s grace is blowing everywhere and at all times. Let us keep the sails unfurled to catch the friendly breeze and make rapid progress in life’s voyage to the heaven of peace, light and blessedness. The lazy and ignorant sailors remain where they are, for they do not know that the wind of God’s grace is all-pervading and ever ready to help and guide all mankind.",
      "It should be understood that mere wishful thinking of spiritual aims does not take a man far in that path. The responsibility is mainly on man. How he progresses and to what end and with what purpose he strives will determine his progress.",
      "Follow my path:In every way, men are treading the path that leads to God. Even a rank materialist who prays for the gratification of material demands is also treading the path to God. For, after some time, he would realise the fleeting nature and futility of earthly pleasures, and then his devotion to God would take an upward turn. He would then seek knowledge, and thus attains the goal. So all men are moving towards the Lord though they follow different paths. What is needed is faith in the Lord. Karma, Bhakti, Dhyana and Jnana are all different paths leading to the Lord.",
      "The present convention, which is one of the most august assemblies ever held, is in itself a vindication, a declaration to the world of the wonderful doctrine preached in the Gita: “Whosoever comes to Me, through whatsoever form, I reach him; all men are struggling through paths which in the end lead to me.” Sectarianism, bigotry, and its horrible descendant, fanaticism, have long possessed this beautiful earth. They have filled the earth with violence, drenched it often and often with human blood, destroyed civilization and sent whole nations to despair. Had it not been for these horrible demons, human society would be far more advanced than it is now. But their time is come; and I fervently hope that the bell that tolled this morning in honour of this convention may be the death-knell of all fanaticism, of all persecutions with the sword or with the pen, and of all uncharitable feelings between persons wending their way to the same goal.[Source]",

      "Her (*) mother’s heart could only be satisfied by conceiving God as her baby. Many and many a time her learned husband had talked to her of Him who is preached in the Vedas, the formless, the infinite, the impersonal. She listened with all attention, and the conclusion was always the same — what is written in the Vedas must be true; but, oh! it was so immense, so far off, and she, only a weak, ignorant woman; and then, it was also written: “In whatsoever form one seeks Me, I reach him in that form, for all mankind are but following the paths I laid down for them” — and that was enough. She wanted to know no more. And there she was — all of the devotion, of faith, of love her heart was capable of, was there in Krishna, the Baby Cowherd, and all that heart entwined round the visible Cowherd, this little bronze image.[Source]",
      "So the ceremonials, worship of gods, and myths, are all right, Krishna says. … Why? Because they all lead to the same goal. Ceremonies, books, and forms— all these are links in the chain. Get hold! That is the one thing. If you are sincere and have really got hold of one link, do not let go; the rest is bound to come. [But people] do not get hold. They spend the time quarrelling and determining what they should get hold of, and do not get hold of anything. … We are always after truth, but never want to get it. We simply want the pleasure to go about and ask. We have a lot of energy and spend it that way. That is why Krishna says: Get hold of any one of these chains that are stretched out from the common centre. No one step is greater than another. … Blame no view of religion so far as it is sincere. Hold on to one of these links, and it will pull you to the centre. Your heart itself will teach all the rest. The teacher within will teach all the creeds, all the philosophies. …",
      "Krishna talks of himself as God, as Christ does. He sees the Deity in himself. And he says, “None can go a day out of my path. All have to come to me. Whosoever wants to worship in whatsoever form, I give him faith in that form, and through that I meet him. … ” His heart is all for the masses.[Source]",
      "Pratyahara and dharana: Krishna says, “All who seek me by whatever means will reach me”, “All must reach me.” Pratyahara is a gathering toward, an attempt to get hold of the mind and focus it on the desired object. The first step is to let the mind drift; watch it; see what it thinks; be only the witness. Mind is not soul or spirit. It is only matter in a finer form, and we own it and can learn to manipulate it through the nerve energies.[Source]",
      "Sri Ramakrishna Says —",
      "The same Being whom the Vedantists call Brahman, is called Atman by the Yogis, and Bhagavan by the Bhaktas. The same Brahamana when he conducts worship is called the priest, but when employed in the kitchen is called a cook.",
      "Thus God the Absolute cannot be thought of apart from the idea of God with attributes, or the Personal God, and vice versa.",
      "God is one, but many are His aspects. As one master of the house appears in various aspects, being father to one, brother to another, and husband to a third, so one God is described and called in various ways according to the particular aspect in which He appears to His particular worshipper.",
      "There are various faiths in the world. As many faiths, so many paths. But everyone thinks his faith alone to be the right one, that his own watch alone is going right! But then, however wrong the other watches may be, the sun is going aright! One has to correct all watches by that.",
      "Many are the names of God and infinite the forms through which He may be approached. In whatever name and form you worship Him, through that He will be realised by you.",
      "God is only one, and not two. Different people call Him by different names, some as Allah, some as God, and others as Krishna, Shiva, and Brahman. It is like the water in a lake. Some drink it at one place and call it jal, others at another place and call it pani, and still others at a third place and call it water. The Hindus call it jal, the Christians water, and the Mussulmans pani. But it is one and the same thing. Opinions are but paths. Each religion is only a path leading to God, as rivers come from different directions and ultimately become one in the one ocean.",
      "A truly religious man should think that other religions also are paths leading to truth. We should always maintain an attitude of respect towards other religions.",
      "Remain always strong and steadfast in your own faith, but eschew all bigotry and intolerance.",
      "(Source: The Message of Ramakrishna)",

      "The Lord declares that in this world success is quickly attained by man for the work that he does. So men worship the Devas like Indra, Varuna etc., and offer sacrifices to them, and the fruits of such works are quickly attained and enjoyed. All the other worlds are places of enjoyment resulting from the work done here. The earth is the world of action (Karma Bhumi) for good or evil. Men attain Heaven or Hell according to the good or evil done by them in this world. When that experience is over, they take birth once again in this world. So this is the centre for spiritual realisation. Let all the seekers take to good work, purify their minds, and attain Knowledge.",
      "If the sick man does not cure himself where is medicine for his disease, what can he do when he goes to a place where there is no medicine? So the wise man should undertake some form of spiritual discipline in this world and attain liberation from the disease of birth and death.",
      "People longing for worldly success worship minor gods or angels, who also are manifestations of the Lord. But on account of their selfish motives, their mode of worship is characterized by the attitude that the devotee and the god are two different beings. “He who, on the other hand, worships a separate god, thinking, ‘He is separate from me and I am separate from him’— he knows not. He is to the gods as cattle are to men.” (Brihadāranyaka Upanishad, I, iv, 10) Worldly success is quickly and easily attained, but not so Self-knowledge. Therefore people do not seek the latter.",
      "They are good-natured, kind, and truthful. All is right with them, but that enjoyment is their God. It is a country where money flows like a river, with beauty as its ripple and learning its waves, and which rolls in luxury. “Longing for success in action, in this world, (men) worship the deities. For success is quickly attained through action in this world of man.” Here you have a wonderful manifestation of grit and power — what strength, what practicality, and what manhood! Horses huge as elephants are drawing carriages that are as big as houses. You may take this as a specimen of the gigantic proportions in other things also. Here is a manifestation of tremendous energy.[Source]",

As a consequence, they obtain soon from those easily propitiated deities kingdom, wealth and such worldly blessings and become so filled with arrogance and infatuation thereby that they forget themselves to the extent of disregarding and becoming oblivious even of the deity who favoured them.",

When man has perforce to do some work, karma-yoga enjoins on him to do it in such a way as will bring freedom through the realization of the Atman. As to your objection that none will be induced to work — the answer is, that whatever work you do has some motive behind it; but when by the long performance of work, one notices that one work merely leads to another, through a round of births and rebirths, then the awakened discrimination of man naturally begins to question itself, “Where is the end to this interminable chain of work?” It is then that he appreciates the full import of the words of the Lord in the Gita: “Inscrutable is the course of work.” Therefore when the aspirant finds that work with motive brings no happiness, then he renounces action. But man is so constituted that to him the performance of work is a necessity, so what work should he take up? He takes up some unselfish work, but gives up all desire for its fruits. For he has known then that in those fruits of work lie countless seeds of future births and deaths. Therefore the knower of Brahman renounces all actions. Although to outward appearances he engages himself in some work, he has no attachment to it. Such men have been described in the scriptures as karma-yogins.[Source]"

      "No action in action:If a man learns to work without the feeling of doership and without desire to enjoy the fruits thereof, he attains complete freedom. Any kind of work, and any amount of it, cannot bind him. So what he does amounts to no action or inaction, just because he knows that he is not doing anything at all, but that the bodily and mental organs and instruments are functioning according to their nature in their own fields of activity. Let us take the illustration of a mirror. Various objects and various forms of action are reflected in it constantly, and yet the minor is not tainted in any way; it remains clear and pure. Even so, the Jnani knows that he is the all-pervading Self and in that Self all actions of the universe are taking place just like those reflected in the mirror. Thus we find that several sages and great men have done great good to mankind through detached and desireless action. Their action, from this point of view, is no action at all so far as they are concerned, as they have entered the Self – state beyond the physical and mental planes. The ignorant man may attribute action to him because he is confused and does not know the secret which the Jnani understands in all the actions. It is this philosophical position which is stated in this apparently paradoxical sentence.",
      "Action in no action:Exactly opposite to these wise men are the idlers who apparently do not do any work but are constantly in a state of action. The idlers refuse to do any work; they are too lazy or too weak in body to perform any work. They may pose as philosophers and Jnanis because their bodily and sense organs are not engaged in any work. But they are always in a state of action because their minds wander about all over the world, think and perform a thousand forms of work, and they live a restless and tortured life. The inherent samskaras play havoc with their mind-stuff which is the root cause of samsara, birth and death. They have not arrived at that state of peace and restfulness which belongs to the highest realm of the Self. The Lord warns the seeker not to fall into this horrible error. Otherwise, man does the greatest injury to himself by confounding the positive peace of self-realisation with the negative state of inaction of the body which is the same as death. He should understand that detachment is a mental attitude born of knowledge and not merely cessation of work. It is not action that binds but egotism and the past evil tendencies of the mind. The body is after all an external instrument. The operator is the mind. It is here that detachment should be cultivated. To restrain the sense-organs and go on thinking of sense pleasures and enjoyments with the mind, is`midhyachara’and Lord has already condemned such men in the Discourse of Karma yoga. The same idea is presented here in a different context.",
      "So, the realised man, whether he is working or not working enjoys the supreme peace of the Self. He gets the highest reward of performing all the good works enjoined by the Sastras. He is rooted in the Self in action and in inaction. For such a man action is not action.",
      "The Lord eulogises the sage who has attained this state as `buddhiman‘ , ‘yuktah’and‘kristnakarmakrit’. By following the path of nishkama karma, he has purified his mind and attained the Atmic state and by that, he has achieved the highest goal of life. For such a man there is nothing more to do, and therefore he is said to have performed all the works enjoined by the Sastras (kristnakarmakrit).",
      "Krishna preached in the midst of the battlefield. “He who in the midst of intense activity finds himself in the greatest calmness, and in the greatest peace finds intense activity, that is the greatest [yogias well as the wisest man].”[Source]",
      "Everything goes to show that this philosophy must be very practical; and later on, when we come to theBhagavad Gita— most of you, perhaps, have read it, it is the best commentary we have on the Vedanta philosophy — curiously enough the scene is laid on the battlefield, where Krishna teaches this philosophy to Arjuna; and the doctrine which stands out luminously in every page of the Gita is intense activity, but in the midst of it, eternal calmness. This is the secret of work, to attain which is the goal of the Vedanta. Inactivity, as we understand it in the sense of passivity, certainly cannot be the goal. Were it so, then the walls around us would be the most intelligent; they are inactive. Clods of earth, stumps of trees, would be the greatest sages in the world; they are inactive. Nor does inactivity become activity when it is combined with passion. Real activity, which is the goal of Vedanta, is combined with eternal calmness, the calmness which cannot be ruffled, the balance of mind which is never disturbed, whatever happens. And we all know from our experience in life that that is the best attitude for work.[Source]",
      "“He who sees in the midst of intense activity, intense calm, and in the midst of intensest peace is intensely active [is wise indeed]. … This is the question: With every sense and every organ active, have you that tremendous peace [so that] nothing can disturb you? Standing on Market Street, waiting for the car with all the rush … going on around you, are you in meditation — calm and peaceful? In the cave, are you intensely active there with all quiet about you? If you are, you are ayogi, otherwise not.[Source]",
      "The ideal man is he who, in the midst of the greatest silence and solitude, finds the intensest activity, and in the midst of the intensest activity finds the silence and solitude of the desert. He has learnt the secret of restraint, he has controlled himself. He goes through the streets of a big city with all its traffic, and his mind is as calm as if he were in a cave, where not a sound could reach him; and he is intensely working all the time. That is the ideal ofkarma-yoga, and if you have attained to that you have really learnt the secret of work.[Source]",
      "“He who in the midst of the greatest activity finds the sweetest peace, and in the midst of the greatest calmness is most active, he has known the secret of life.” Krishna shows the way how to do this — by being non-attached: do everything but do not get identified with anything. You are the soul, the pure, the free, all the time; you are the Witness. Our misery comes, not from work, but by our getting attached to something.[Source]",
      "When we come to that non-attachment, then we can understand the marvellous mystery of the universe; how it is intense activity and vibration, and at the same time intensest peace and calm; how it is work every moment and rest every moment. That is the mystery of the universe — the impersonal and personal in one, the infinite and finite in one. Then we shall find the secret. “He who finds in the midst of intense activity the greatest rest, and in the midst of the greatest rest intense activity, he has become ayogi.” He alone is a real worker, none else. We do a little work and break ourselves. Why? We become attached to that work. If we do not become attached, side by side with it we have infinite rest.[Source]",
      "Therefore Krishna teaches us not to shirk our duties, but to take them up manfully, and not think of the result. The servant has no right to question. The soldier has no right to reason. Go forward, and do not pay too much attention to the nature of the work you have to do. Ask your mind if you are unselfish. If you are, never mind anything, nothing can resist you! Plunge in! Do the duty at hand. And when you have done this, by degrees you will realize the Truth: “Whosoever in the midst of intense activity finds intense peace, whosoever in the midst of the greatest peace finds the greatest activity, he is ayogi, he is a great soul, he has arrived at perfection.”[Source]",
      "Most of us cannot keep our activities on a par with our thought-lives. Some blessed ones can. Most of us seem to lose the power of work as we think deeper, and the power of deep thought if we work more. That is why most great thinkers have to leave to time the practical realization of their great ideals. Their thoughts must wait for more active brains to work them out and spread them. Yet, as we write, comes before us a vision of him, the charioteer of Arjuna, standing in his chariot between the contending hosts, his left hand curbing the fiery steeds — a mail-clad warrior, whose eagle-glance sweeps over the vast army, and as if by instinct weighs every detail of the battle array of both parties — at the same time that we hear, as it were, falling from his lips and thrilling the awe-struck Arjuna, that most marvellous secret of work: “He who finds rest in the midst of activity, and activity in rest, he is the wise amidst men, he theyogi, he is the doer of all work.”[Source]",
      "Swamiji: A very funny thing happened today. I went to a friend’s house. He has had a picture painted, the subject of which is “Shri Krishna addressing Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra”. Shri Krishna stands on the chariot, holding the reins in His hand and preaching the Gita to Arjuna. He showed me the picture and asked me how I liked it. “Fairly well”, I said. But as he insisted on having my criticism on it, I had to give my honest opinion by saying, “There is nothing in it to commend itself to me; first, because the chariot of the time of Shri Krishna was not like the modern pagoda-shaped car, and also, there is no expression in the figure of Shri Krishna.”",
      "Q. — How then should Shri Krishna be represented in the picture in question?",
      "Swamiji: Shri Krishna ought to be painted as He really was, the Gita personified; and the central idea of the Gita should radiate from His whole form as Hewas teaching the path of dharma to Arjuna, who had been overcome by infatuation and cowardice.",
      "So saying Swamiji posed himself in the way in which Shri Krishna should be portrayed, and continued: “Look here, thus does he hold the bridle of the horses — so tight that they are brought to their haunches, with their forelegs fighting the air, and their mouths gaping. This will show a tremendous play of action in the figure of Shri Krishna. His friend, the world-renowned hero, casting aside his bow and arrows, has sunk down like a coward on the chariot, in the midst of the two armies. And Shri Krishna, whip in one hand and tightening the reins with the other, has turned Himself towards Arjuna, with his childlike face beaming with unworldly love and sympathy, and a calm and serene look — and is delivering the message of the Gita to his beloved comrade. Now, tell me what idea this picture of the Preacher of the Gita conveys to you.”",
      "The friend: Activity combined with firmness and serenity.",
      "Swamiji: Ay, that’s it! Intense action in the whole body, and withal a face expressing the profound calmness and serenity of the blue sky. This is the central idea of the Gita — to be calm and steadfast in all circumstances, with one’s body, mind, and soul centred at His hallowed Feet! … He who even while doing action can keep his mind calm, and in whom, even when not doing any outward action, flows the current of activity in the form of the contemplation of Brahman, is the intelligent one among men, he indeed is theyogi, he indeed is the perfect worker.[Source]",
      "The Bhagavad Gita says, “He who finds action in inaction, and inaction in action, he is a perfect yogi” (4.18). Amidst the hectic surroundings and crowds, Saradananda continued his serious writing project. One day some young monks were talking loudly and laughing in the Udbodhan office, adjacent to the swami’s room. Golap-ma, an attendant of Holy Mother, scolded them: “Shame on you! Mother is upstairs and Sharat is doing serious work, and you boys are making such great noise!” Overhearing Golap-ma’s loud voice, the swami said to her: “Well, Golap-ma, please don’t give your ears to them. It is the nature of the boys to behave like that. I am so close to them, but I don’t listen to what they are talking about. I have told my ears, ‘Don’t listen to anything that is unnecessary.’ So my ears are not listening to them.” Saradananda had total control over his senses. (Source: God Lived with Them)",

      "From the spiritual point of view, a Pandit is one who has freed himself from desire and volition in performing all practical work in the world. Book-learning, intellectual gymnastics may dazzle the minds of the ignorant, but the all knowing Lord does not care for such barren learning, and the title Pandit is given only to the sage who can act without desire and egotism and whose actions are burnt in the fire of Self knowledge.",
      "Free from desire and volition:‘Kama’ means desire for enjoyment, `samkalpa’ means thought arising from egotism, which expresses itself in statements like “I will fight, I will acqure wealth and fame” and so on. Even thoughts like – “I will help mankind – I will do good to society” pertain to the ego and come under the category of `samkalpa’. The wise man works without such personal motive. He has understood the mystery of his real Self, and so when he acts, the action is thought of and executed by higher power than himself through the instrumentality of his vehicle (upadhi). He feels no personal responsibility at all. It is in this way that the greatest works are performed by rare men from time to time.",
      "The doubt may arise whether any action is possible without `Samkalpa’. The Lord clears the doubt and emphatically declares that work is possible without ‘samkalpa’, in the sense that man acts like an instrument in the hands of a higher power than himself. The human agent is a visible agent of action (Nimithamatram), whereas the real power that does everything is the Lord Himself.",
      "Whose actions are burnt in the fire of knowledge:The fire of Atmajnana burns up the whole heap of karma accumulated through several births, as soft cotton is burnt to ashes by a spark of fire. Such is the power of Self-Knowledge. The man who attains it is freed from the bondage of karma forever. There is no further birth and death for him. There is no going to this or that heaven. The endless peregrination from one world to another comes to an end. He remains established in the Self-state. It is towards this consummation that man is striving. Nishkamakarma purifies the mind, and when the mind is purified, that ideal of Self-realisation is obtained.",

He is wise.” Reading books cannot do that. The ass can be burdened with the whole library; that does not make him learned at all. What is the use of reading many books?[Source]",
      "(To the devotees) “God made me pass through the disciplines of various paths. First according to the Purana, then according to the Tantra. I also followed the disciplines of the Vedas. At first I practised sadhana in the Panchavati. I made a grove of tulsi-plants and used to sit inside it and meditate. Sometimes I cried with a longing heart, ‘Mother! Mother!’ Or again, ‘Rama! Rama!’“While repeating the name of Rama, I sometimes assumed the attitude of Hanuman and fixed a tail to the lower end of my backbone. I was in a God-intoxicated state. At that time I used to put on a silk robe and worship the Deity. What joy I experienced in that worship!“I practised the discipline of the Tantra under the bel-tree. At that time I could see no distinction between the sacred tulsi and any other plant. In that state I sometimes ate the leavings from a jackal’s meal,9food that had been exposed the whole night, part of which might have been eaten by snakes or other creatures. Yes, I ate that stuff.“Sometimes I rode on a dog and fed him with luchi, also eating part of the bread myself.I realised that the whole world was filled with God alone. One cannot have spiritual realisation without destroying ignorance; so I would assume the attitude of a tiger and devour ignorance.“While practising the disciplines of the Vedas, I became a sannyasi. I used to lie down in the chandni and say to Hriday: ‘I am a sannyasi. I shall take my meals here.’10“I vowed to the Divine Mother that I would kill myself if I did not see God. I said to Her: ‘O Mother, I am a fool. Please teach me what is contained in the Vedas, the Puranas, the Tantras, and the other scriptures.’ The Mother said to me,‘The essence of the Vedanta is that Brahman alone is real and the world illusory.’The Satchidananda Brahman described in the Vedas is the Satchidananda Siva of the Tantra and the Satchidananda Krishna of the Purana. The essence of theGitais what you get by repeating the word ten times. It is reversed into ‘tagi’, which indicates renunciation.“After the realisation of God, how far below lie the Vedas, the Vedanta, the Purana, the Tantra! (To Hazra) I cannot utter the word ‘Om’ in samadhi. Why is that? I cannot say ‘Om’ unless I come down very far from the state of samadhi. (Source:Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna)",

They are ever content because they experience the bliss of the Self beyond which there is no delight anywhere at all. Their content is not conditioned by time, place, and circumstances and therefore they are ever content‘nityatriptah’. The ignorant man is always seeking refuge in this or that material object because the gross mind can only exist by clinging to such gross objects however wretched they might be. Without such a prop, he cannot live. That is why man clings to objects in spite of all the suffering that they caused both by possession and non-possession. The wise man, on the other hand, has found his abode of peace in Atma, and never falls down to the plane of the matter though he lives in a physical body. For such a man action is no action.

      "Three attributes of the Jivanmukta are mentioned here – (1 ) desireless, (2) self-controlled (3) abandoning all possessions. The man who has no desire to enjoy the pleasures of the objective world has his mind turned inwards in the contemplation of Atma. He finds all happiness there. So even though he works he cannot have any attachment for the fruits of work. Self-control leads to Atmajnana. When the senses and the mind are restrained, naturally man becomes free from the enticing temptation of the material world with all its glamour and attraction. When such a man works, he has no feeling of attachment for any material object at all. The third attribute `aparigraha‘ should be carefully noted by the aspirant. Non-receiving of gifts and possessions is enjoined by the Sastras as a very important discipline for the seeker. When one receives gifts from others he takes with them part of the karma of the giver. The very purpose of the seeker (i.e.) to get rid of karma is defeated. Why should he add to his own load the sins of others by receiving worthless possessions of material things? Non-receiving (Aparigraha) is therefore enjoined as the rule of conduct for all spiritual aspirants."

These qualities distinguish the Jivanmukta and the perfect Karma yogi.",
      "Work and wisdom, knowledge and action, are interdependent. It is only the man of knowledge who can be a perfect Karma yogi. Unless one acquires the knowledge of the Self, it is impossible to work without attachment, to go beyond the pairs of opposites, and to be free from the evil of malice. Thus the Jnani who is acting in the world is not bound by karma. How is this knowledge of Self to be attained? Unless a man undertakes selfless, desireless work, he cannot obtain purity of mind, and unless the mind is purified of all its evil tendencies of ‘raga and dvesha’, he cannot realise Atma. So these two aspects go together in the spiritual progress of man towards perfection. That is the reason why at the end of the Third Discourse on Karma yoga, the Lord declares the perfection of Self-realisation, and here in Jnana yoga, the secret of Karma yoga is emphasised prominently.",
      "The Jnani is in a state of absorption in the Self, and so what he does with the bodily vehicle cannot bind him. He knows clearly that he has nothing to gain or lose by action or inaction because he is united with Brahman. As long as the body lasts, its maintenance is carried on automatically without any samkalpa on his part. In this way, the bodily vehicle and the mental instruments are used for the good of humanity without egotism or any sense of personal doership. Such a man is not bound by what he does.",

Actions drop away when one realises God, as the flower drops of itself when the fruit appears.(BG 3.17,BG 3.18)“He who has realised God no longer performs religious duties such as the sandhya. In his case the sandhya merges in the Gayatri. When that happens, it is enough for a person to repeat just the Gayatri mantra. Then the Gayatri merges in Om. After that one no longer chants even the Gayatri; it is enough then to chant simply Om. How long should a man practise such devotions as the sandhya? As long as he does not feel a thrill in his body and shed tears of joy while repeating the name of Rama or of Hari. People worship God to win money or a lawsuit. That is not good.”A DEVOTEE:“We find that everyone strives after money. Even Keshab Sen married his daughter to a prince.”MASTER:“Keshab’s case is quite different.God provides everything for a genuine devotee, even without his making any effort. The son of a real king gets his monthly allowance. I am not talking of lawyers and men of that sort, who go through suffering in order to earn money, and who become slaves of others to that end. I am speaking of a real prince. A true devotee has no desire. He does not care for money. Money comes to him of itself.

It means dispassion for the world and also longing for God.”(Admin Note:The Tree Analogy in Bhagavad Gita and Story of Two Birds in Mundaka Upanishad explain this only.)Master:“You are right.You no doubt need money for your worldly life; but don’t worry too much about it.

    "commentary": [
      "The essential qualities of the man of Knowledge are described here (1) Non-attachment, (2) freedom from desire and hatred, attraction and repulsion, (3) absorption in Atma, (4) performing work in a spirit of sacrifice. The Karma of the sage who possesses these qualities is entirely dissolved.",
      "Whose mind is established in Knowledge:The mind of the sage is established in Knowledge. Such Knowledge is the result of non-attachment to the fruits of work, and liberation from agitations of desire and hatred. For such a man, though he is engaged in a thousand actions, all that he does is totally dissolved in the ocean of Knowledge. So it is clear that Knowledge of Self is the only way to cut the bonds of karma. Without true Knowledge, man is inevitably bound to the material world through his unrestrained senses and mind and what he does is motivated by desire and egotism, and so he binds himself to the wheel of samsara. This bondage is the creation of man’s own mind and is not the effect of the objective world. In fact, the objective world exists as it is, and man attaches himself to it by his past samskaras and suffers the unavoidable consequences of birth and death. The sage has discovered the original freedom of his own Self and so he has released himself from the enslaving forces of the senses and the mind. Such a man is not bound by karma, because there is no desire for personal enjoyment and there is no feeling of doership. His work is thus dissolved in Knowledge.",
      "Performed in the spirit of sacrifice:In the Third Discourse, it has already been stated that work done with any other motive except as dedicated to the Lord, as Dharma or as service to humanity, will cause bondage.",
      "It dissolved:It is emphatically stated here that nothing remains of karma for the man who has realised Brahman. Sanchita and Agami karma are destroyed in the fire of Knowledge. Only Prarabdha remains as long as the body lasts, and when the body falls, it is all over. There is no mind, no karma to lead to further births.",
      "These ideas are a source of great thought for the man of action, the devotee, and the aspirant for liberation. All of these are seeking emancipation from the bondage of karma. And the message of the Gita is not the abandoning of action but the freedom of man through right action. The secret is revealed how a man should work and yet remain free from being caught in the meshes of karma."

      "Everything in the yajna is Brahman. The verse enunciates the Upanishadic truth.",
      "Keeping this truth in mind one should work; yajna is Brahman in every part and in all its details.",
      "If all this – the whole universe with all the beings in it and all the actions taking place in it – is Brahman, the One Reality without a second, why and wherefore the manifoldness? Name and form (nama and rupa) have super-imposed the diversity on the supreme Brahman. What is superimposed cannot change the nature of the original substance. The snake that is superimposed on the rope out of the delusion of the eye cannot change the nature of the rope. The rope remains the rope even when the snake is superimposed on it by the illusion of the eye. When the illusion passes away by focussing the light on the object, the rope is seen and known as the rope. So, all the time what existed was the rope only and nothing else. Even so, the world of name and form has been superimposed by the delusion of the mind and the senses on the supreme Brahman. When the delusion is cleared and the mind is purified, all this shall be seen and known as Brahman. The sage knows the truth. Everything that we see, feel, and think, and every action of ours is Brahman and nothing exists other than Brahman. It is this fundamental truth that is affirmed in this verse by the illustration of yajna. The oblation is Brahman. The material used is Brahman. The fire is Brahman. The sacrifice is Brahman. The act of sacrifice is Brahman. Thus contemplating, man realises Brahman everywhere and in all things.",
      "Yajnais taken as an illustration because at the end of Dvaparayuga, sacrifices were performed elaborately by all people and they were familiar with the rites and rituals. The principle is applicable to everything and every action that man does. He is blessed who acts in the understanding and experience of the truth that all is Brahman.",
      "By absorption:Here the technique of transforming all work into Brahman is indicated. By concentration and meditation, by constant absorption in Brahman, every kind of work that is done melts into Brahman. Work then loses its separate limited quality, its binding power. It acquires a divine and spiritual quality. The distinction between karma and jnana is thus eliminated, and Brahman alone is realised in all that one thinks and does. The seeker should understand the importance of this verse which shows the direct path to Brahmajnana. Any man in any work of life doing any kind of work can practice this method and reach the goal. There is a tradition among people to repeat this verse while taking food. The food is Brahman, the feeder is Brahman, and the act of eating is Brahman. It is again an affirmation that everything and every act is That, appearing to be manifold by the super-imposition of name and form.",
      "Kedar sang several other songs. After the music the Master again talked to the devotees. Nandalal, Keshab’s nephew, was also present with a few Brahmo friends. They were sitting near the Master.MASTER (to Vijay and the other devotees): “A man brought a bottle of consecrated wine for me; but I couldn’t even touch it.”VIJAY: “Ah!”MASTER: “I become intoxicated at the mere thought of God. I don’t have to take any wine. I feel drunk at the very sight of the charanamrita.5I feel as if I had drunk five bottles of liquor. When a person attains such a state he cannot help discriminating about food.”NARENDRA: “As regards food, one should take whatever comes.”MASTER: “What you say applies only to a particular state of the aspirant’s mind. No food can harm a jnani.According to theGita, the jnani himself does not eat; his eating is an offering to the Kundalini.But that does not apply to a bhakta. The present state of my mind is such that I cannot eat any food unless it is first offered to God by a brahmin priest. Formerly my state of mind was such that I would enjoy inhaling the smell of burning corpses, carried by the wind from the other side of the Ganges. It tasted very sweet to me. But nowadays I cannot eat food touched by anybody and everybody. No, I cannot. But once in a while I do. One day I was taken to see a performance of a play at Keshab’s house. They gave me luchi and curries to eat. I didn’t know whether the food was handed to me by a washerman or a barber; but I ate quite a little. (All laugh.) Rakhal had asked me to eat. (To Narendra) “With you it is all right. You are in ‘this’ as well as in ‘that’.6You can eat everything now. (To the devotees) Blessed is he who feels longing for God, though he eats pork. But shame on him whose mind dwells on ‘woman and gold’, though he eats the purest food — boiled vegetables, rice, and ghee. (Source:Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna)",

      "(2) Others perform sacrifice to Brahman by offering his separate individuality (jiva) as oblation in the fire of Brahman. Fire consumes everything and converts all into its own element. Similarly, the whole of the objective world melts into Brahman. The mind and ego are also objective phenomena pertaining to the inner nature of man. So the yogis offer them as oblation in the fire of Brahman (i.e.) they are absorbed into Brahman and lose their separate limited personalities. These are the Jnanayogis. This sacrifice leads to identity with Brahman ultimately. By inquiring into the real nature of man, by indisposition towards the objects of the world, by the eradication of bad samskaras, the mind which keeps up the illusion of duality is so purified that it is merged in Brahman. This is the liberated state of the jnanayogi. This isBrahmajnana."

      "Here two types of yajna are mentioned -(1) restraining the senses (2) rejecting the sense – objects.",
      "Sense – restraint is the key to Brahmajnana, – and so the Lord insists on this discipline many times in the Gita.",
      "So, sense control is the first of all spiritual disciplines. Vedantic perorations without sense-control do not have either light or power in them. The man of sense-control, though he does not talk anything, communicates Vedantic truth to the ends of the world even without one spoken word. The sense-control is here mentioned as a sacrifice. Liberation can be attained only by mind-control. and this depends on sense restraint. By practising several kinds of penance by following several vows. rules and regulations of conduct, the seeker should get the senses under control. This is what is meant by sacrificing the senses in the fire of restraint. The plural form ‘fires’ is used because there are different senses to be controlled.",
      "The second yajna mentioned here is closely related to the first. The senses, according to their nature, wander about freely in the objective world, experiencing pleasure and pain through pleasant and unpleasant objects. Therefore one has to reject the sense objects by deeply examining them and understanding how painful and worthless they are. When one realises the worthlessness and shadowy nature of these sense objects, the senses do not run after them. They remain steadfast in their own seats. It is the rushing out of the senses towards material objects that disturbs the mind and throws it into a state of commotion. When the senses are kept in their place, the mind is calm and when the mind is calm, the bliss of Alma is experienced. This is sacrificing the sense-objects in the fire of the senses."

To conquer the mind, various spiritual disciplines are necessary. Restraining the senses and controlling the breath are essential for mind – control. Otherwise, the force of the senses and the ill-regulated health disturb the mind-stuff endlessly. So the seeker should gradually practise sense-restraint(indriyanigraha)and breath-regulation (pranayama). This idea – is figuratively described as sacrificing the senses and the vital energy (prana) in the fire of self-control.",
      "Illumined by Knowledge:Jnana is compared to light. By sense-control and self-control, the light of knowledge shines brightest. On the other side, by discrimination and knowledge of the Self, the mind is brought under control. Therefore it is here said that self-control is illumined by knowledge. The fire of self-control is fawned into flame by knowledge. It means that those who aspire for mind-control should practise discrimination and enquiry into the Self. The seeker has to carry on the enquiry – “what and whence this universe? what is the reality behind all this?” By such enquiry, the mind ceases to run after the transitory things of the objective world and turns towards that which is the basis of all – Atma. It is evident from this epithet that the Atmic state is the absolute fulness of light, knowledge and bliss.",

The past Samskaras, the physical habits and mental tendencies have become a part and parcel of one’s nature. To change them is indeed an uphill task.Perseverance will ultimately conquer. Nothing can be done in a day. All crookedness shall be made straight in course of time. The idle and weak cannot make any progress. Spiritual realisation has its price and the price is self-control and renunciation. Renunciation of what? Of all the silly and worthless pleasures of the world. Indeed the price is very small compared to the fruit of attainment – the eternal bliss of Brahmajnana. It is like obtaining pure gold in exchange for worthless alloy. Who would not pay this price willingly and correctly? The difficulty is not so great as it is thought of. The initial attempt disturbs the body and the mind as a result of the new discipline. But the discipline itself becomes natural by habit.The ascetic (Yati) mentioned here is not aSanyasibut a worker on the spiritual path. A huge tree cannot be cut with a nail-chipper; the axe is needed. And the axe to cut the mighty tree of ignorance and delusion is persistent, hard, unremitting discipline, restraint and control."

When a gust of passion disturbs the mind, the breath becomes at once irregular, and as the passion cools down the breath also becomes normal. When the breath is irregular owing to some physical exertion, it is again impossible to concentrate the mind. So regularity of breathing always accompanies mental concentration. By controlling the breath, the mind is also controlled. For this reason, breath control is prescribed as a healthy and helpful practice in spiritual life. The seeker has to learn the technique from a competent master. Here breath-control is mentioned as a form of sacrifice."

      "Thus far the Lord has explained twelve different types of yajnas. Of these, the last two are the regulation and control of food – habits. No one should commit the mistake of doubting what connection there is between food and spiritual attainment. Without fear of any exaggeration, it can be asserted that food is the first thing about which the seeker should be extremely careful. Otherwise, all his effort will come to naught. Over-eating or under-eating, eating at all odd times, in all places, all types of food from all kinds of persons, – all these should be carefully avoided. It is food that is turned into physical energy which in its turn is turned into mental energy that leads to spiritual illumination. Impure food not only unhinges the physical body but also irritates and provokes all kinds of undesirable humours which are detrimental to self-control. Some kinds of food like meat, garlic, and spices induce physical aberration like indulgence in sex and irritability of temper, cruelty in word and deed, and other discordant impulses. They are all obstacles to spiritual progress.",
      "Just as a loose nut in a complicated machine brings it to a standstill, just as a train meets with disaster if one of the sleepers is taken off, even so the whole system of spiritual life is disrupted if care is not taken about food. If the food is pure, the mind is pure; if the mind is pure, liberation is attained. The Lord here mentions that regulation of food is also a yajna. There are five conditions to determine the quality of food (1) purity (2) moderation, (3) righteous earning, (4) offering to the Lord, and (5) timeliness.",
      "The Lord has described various spiritual disciplines and each of them is given the sacred name of yajna. We understand that the old concept of yajna as a Vedic ritual accompanied by elaborate technique is given up, and a new significance is attached to other forms of discipline. Besides, it is here affirmed that all those who practise any of these disciplines are knowers of sacrifice(vajnavidah).",
      "What then is the use of yajnas? It is the first and last method of purification. All the sins of the past and all the evil tendencies of the mind are destroyed by yajna. So it is imperative that the seeker should undertake some form of discipline and strive to attain purity which alone can lead him to Self realisation.",

In this world, man endures all troubles for the purpose of acquiring a bit of wealth or pleasure or fame. After all, they are brief and short-lived. But the knowledge of Self is an eternal blessing for man. Should we not aspire for it? If the same energy one expends for possessing this or that worldly object, is directed towards the spiritual goal, man can achieve the highest even in this life. The Lord has offered ample choice in selecting the yajna most available to each individual. Various paths are open for this spiritual quest. Let people be alert and watchful, and they shall attain the goal.",
      "The non- sacrificer loses both worlds. What enjoyment or happiness or joy can he have even in this world? Indisciplined men who have neither will nor knowledge cannot hope to make anything even in this earthly life. It is all misery, doubt and despair for them, and such men proceed from sorrow to sorrow. It should be understood that success in attaining purity is also the fruit of sacrifice (i.e.,) the result of self-discipline and proper action. If one cannot do this, how can one hope to enter a higher world? The Lord calls on mankind – “O ye mortal beings! Having attained this human birth, if you do nothing for your spiritual uplift, you cannot get anything even in this life, much less in the next world.”",
      "Those who eat the remnant of sacrifice:Food is not a necessary ingredient in such yajnas like sense-restraint, self-control, pranayama, etc. So in these cases, the word food may be understood as the nectar of peace and joy arising from spiritual practices.",
      "Question:What is the nature of Brahman?",
      "Answer:Eternal and imperishable.",

      "Answer:Those who take the remnant of sacrifice.",

      "Born of action:These sacrifices are all different modes of action. Speech is action, thought is action, work done with the body is action, the operation of the senses is action. So, action well-planned and executed with resolution is the cause of yajna. Individual effort is essential for the performance of Yajna. Inaction leads to nothing. Spirituality is indeed a practical science and not an empty talk. So the seekers should use each one of their faculties, physical and mental, for the purpose of performing these sacrifices. Such determined action alone can yield the highest fruit of liberation. The Lord exhorts all mankind to take to a life of action, perform yajna, purify the mind, and attain Brahman. In fact, the despondency of Arjuna was a cowardly renunciation of action which he thought was a state of jnana. The Lord explains that such spurious and sentimental inaction is a sign of ignorance, and on the other side, one should act fearlessly and selflessly, so that the path may be opened for spiritual Knowledge in due course.

      "Jnana – yajna implies enquiry into the Truth, the pursuit of reality. Discrimination between Atma and Anatma, the Seer and the Seen, hearing of Truth, thinking and meditating on Truth, restraining the senses, controlling the mind, the destruction of the latent tendencies, all these are comprehended by the term Jnana Yajna.",
      "Dravya yajna means sacrifice performed with the aid of material objects. It is here said that Jnana Yajna is superior to Dravya Yajna. The reason is that hat Self-realisation (Atma Jnana), is the ultimate goal of all embodied beings. Man has forgotten his real nature by ignorance, and to become aware of his real Self is the object of all religions and philosophy. All religious practices lead finally to this knowledge. The fruits of all sacrifices are comprehended in Self-Knowledge, the supreme bliss and blessedness of Brahman. So whatever fruits are obtainable by the performance of Dravya Yajna are fully and completely realised in Brahma Jnana. Therefore it is declared that Jnana Yajna is superior to all others. It is the yajna par excellence.",
      "The end of all forms of Karma is knowledge. The sacrifices purify the mind, remove all sins, and in that way render Self – Knowledge possible. And, just as the rivers join the ocean, so also all the works with their fruits are merged in Brahman.The idea is that the fruits of karma are not destroyed but fully realised in the bliss of Brahma Jnana.",
      "So every man should strive for wisdom, and towards that end, he should take the aid of Yajna in the form of some good works. Whatever may be the practice followed, its goal is wisdom. At some time or other, everyone should acquire this knowledge by which he attains liberation.",
      "Karma is ‘sadhana’ knowledge is‘sadhya’. Karma takes man to the threshold of Jnana, and Jnana lifts him up to the heights of the liberated state. From this, we understand that liberation is not a sudden blast of knowledge, but the end of a long process of good and righteous action. By ceaseless devotion to God, man acquires His grace, and He by his infinite compassion opens the eye of wisdom in man and Atma is then perceived. Even after self-realisation, some wise men continue to work for the benefit of humanity. Thus in this verse, the excellence of Jnana and the need for Karma are both emphasised.",
      "As to the so-called Hindu idolatry — first go and learn the forms they are going through, and where it is that the worshippers are really worshipping, whether in the temple, in the image, or in the temple of their own bodies. First know for certain what they are doing — which more than ninety per cent of the revilers are thoroughly ignorant of — and then it will explain itself in the light of the Vedantic philosophy. Still these karmas are not compulsory. On the other hand, open your Manu and see where it orders every old man to embrace the fourth ashrama, and whether he embraces it or not, he must give up all karma. It is reiterated everywhere that all these karmas “finally end in jnana”.[Source]",
      "Disciple:Sir, now you are speaking of jnana; but sometimes you proclaim the superiority of bhakti, sometimes of karma, and sometimes of yoga. This confuses our understanding.",
      "Swamiji:Well, the truth is this. The knowledge of Brahman is the ultimate goal — the highest destiny of man. But man cannot remain absorbed in Brahman all the time. When he comes out of it, he must have something to engage himself. At that time he should do such work as will contribute to the real well-being of people. Therefore do I urge you in the service of jivas (The living beings) in a spirit of oneness. But, my son, such are the intricacies of work, that even great saints are caught in them and become attached. Therefore work has to be done without any desire for results. This is the teaching of the Gita. But know that in the knowledge of Brahman there is no touch of any relation to work. Good works, at the most, purify the mind. Therefore has the commentator Shankara so sharply criticized the doctrine of the combination of jnana and karma. Some attain to the knowledge of Brahman by the means of unselfish work. This is also a means, but the end is the realization of Brahman. Know this thoroughly that the goal of the path of discrimination and of all other modes of practice is the realization of Brahman.[Source]",

    ],
    "commentary": [
      "In the previousverse, the excellence of Jnana is declared. The question of how and from whom such knowledge could be obtained is answered here.",
      "The seers of truth:Brahma jnana can be obtained only from the sages who have directly perceived the Truth. They are men who have realised the Self and transcended all the doubts and complications of earthly life. They have seen the Truth of the Vedas and Sastras. They have gone beyond them. Such men indeed are very rare. But they alone are qualified to instruct the aspirant in Self – Knowledge. The Lord uses the term‘tattvadarsinah’(The seers of Truth) to distinguish these from others who have only read about Truth in books. Such book learning is far different from actual Self-realisation. Truth is a direct experience. For such men, Truth is as clear as material objects are clear to us. When one speaks of sages who have seen the Truth, he should not imagine that Truth is something external to them like a pole or wall or tree. Truth is not different from one’s own Self which is also the Self in every being. Thus, sages who are directly experiencing the Self-state are world-teachers from whom the sincere aspirants obtain Knowledge of Atma.",
      "What are the qualifications of the aspirant and under what conditions would they receive the blessing of the Master? Three conditions are prescribed.",
      "(1) The seeker should approach the Master in all humility and prostrate himself at the feet of the Master (Pranipatena). Pride and egotism should be utterly crushed when the seeker stands in the presence of the Master. The seeker may be a King ruling over millions of people, but the pride of position counts for nothing when he stands before the Knower of Brahman. The seeker may be an intellectual giant, but the supremacy of learning counts for nothing before the Knower of Brahman. The seeker may belong to a high caste, but the superiority of caste counts for nothing before a Knower of Brahman. In short, all power and position, all wealth and nd treasure, are not in the least helpful to obtaining that Knowledge which brings man face to face with Truth.",
      "From the Upanishads and Puranas we get several illustrations of such humility on the part of learned Kings and Emperors who desired to know the Truth. They have walked bare-footed to some mountain – cave where the sage lived with only a loin cloth to cover his nakedness, with only roots and leaves to sustain his mortal body. Humility is the first condition imposed. Does the all-renouncing sage expect any honour from those who go to him? Not at all. He is indifferent to honour and dishonour. It is for the benefit of the seker that humility is prescribed as a condition, and not to confer honour on the sages. By such humility, the seeker overcomes the first and last obstacle on the path of Self-realisation, (i.e.) egotism, a clinging to the little self which produces a sense of false pride and greatness. So humility is the role of conduct for all seekers in the presence of the Master.",
      "Brahma Jnana is superior to everything else in the world. Let us recall to mind the great combative encounter between Vasishta and Viswamitra. Viswamitra used all the weapons against Vasishta who defended himself with his lone Brahmadanda. All the weapons were swallowed up by the Brahmadanda, as the ocean swallows up all the floods in the world. Viswamitra then understood the superior power of Brahman.",
      "The knower of Brahman has such power but he never uses it. Against whom and for what purpose should he use it? The sage is embodied wisdom, is God Himself in the embodied state. So the seeker of knowledge should prostrate himself before the Master with a deep feeling of humility and obedience. According to ordinary custom, people remove their footwear and head-dress when they go to the temple. Pride and egotism which cling to the body should be given up when one meets a great Master from whom he hopes to receive spiritual illumination.",
      "(2)By question:Having prostrated himself before the Master, the seeker should then humbly ask the Guru to teach him, to clear his doubts, to lift him from the mine of delusion, to give him peace, and to help him to realise the Truth. The aim of the seeker should be to receive light and not to test the Master’s capacity to argue with him, or examine the depth of his scholarship. Such an arrogant attitude is futile. The Master is not disturbed or perturbed by the puzzles and riddles of the questioner. But the seeker loses the very aim of his quest by foolish argumentation. The Master knows by a single glance at the seeker what type of man he is, what doubts he has, what obstacles there are for him to overcome, and gives him suitable instructions. But he does so only when he is convinced about the sincerity of the seeker. Otherwise, the Master can do nothing to communicate his knowledge to the disciple. So it is prescribed as the second condition that the seeker should humbly place his doubts before the Master and accept his guidance.",
      "(3)By service:Service to the Master is the third condition. Blessed are those who have opportunities of such divine service. To wash the Master’s clothes, dry them and keep them ready for his use, to massage his feet, to prepare food for him, to bring fruits and flowers for his worship, in these ways to serve the Master and win his grace is the duty of the aspirant. It should be remembered that the Master is not in need of somebody’s service. It is meant only for the benefit of the disciple. It is an act of devotion. If the Master employs him in some work, it is a blessing that the Master confers on the aspirant. We come across instances of utterly literate persons rising to the heights of spiritual glory by simple devoted service to the Master. Their love for the Guru is the open secrect of Self-realisation, and service works the miracle.",
      "When the seeker fulfills these conditions, the Master out of his mercy instructs him in Brahmajnana. The right approach of the seeker induces the right spirit of the Master. It is the duty of the Master to help the aspirant in his quest for Truth, and he does so out of compassion and not for any material reward. Those great Masters are naturally full of pity for suffering humanity, and when people come to them loaded with sorrow and crushed by suffering, they are moved by cosmic compassion and do everything possible to save the stricken souls from sorrow and delusion.",
      "What is that the Master teaches? Truth, which they have known and seen, in which they have their life and being.",
      "This verse explains clearly the relationship between the Master and the disciple and the duties of each in relation to the other. We understand how the Masters and disciples lived in ancient hermitages. Even today there are Masters of this type if only the seeker is keen about his quest. The very power of the disciple’s aspiration for knowledge will draw to him the right type of Master from the unknown regions of the earth. This is the simple law of magnetism and no real aspirant need to be disheartened that he is not able to get the proper Guru (master). The Guru is always there if the seeker’s aspiration is sufficiently intense to draw him into orbit.",
      "Here a doubt may be created about why Lord Krishna asks Arjuna to seek out a Master and learn the Truth. (1) It may be that the Lord wants Arjuna to confirm his realisation by instructions from a Guru. (2) It may be that the Lord is just describing the normal mode of spiritual instruction in the world.",
      "Swamiji began to speak to the disciple [Sharat Chandra Chakravarty], enjoining him to be reverential to the Math members: “These children of Shri Ramakrishna whom you see, are wonderful tyagis (selfless souls), and by service to them you will attain to the purification of mind and be blessed with the vision of the Atman. You remember the words of the Gita: ‘By interrogation and service to the great soul’. Therefore you must serve them, by which you will attain your goal; and you know how much they love you.”[Source]",

      "The Knowledge received from the Brahmanishta Guru consists of (1) the removal of all former delusions forever, and (2) the perception of all beings in one’s own Self and also in God. Let us understand these two aspects in Jnana.",
      "(1) The proof of having eyes is not to fall into the pit. If a person falls, it is clear that he cannot see. Thus the proof of Brahmajnana is the clearing away of all delusions which have been haunting man from time immemorial.Atma, the Self, is alone real and all else is an illusion. To know this from experience is Jnana.How can that wise man be deluded again? He sees everything as his own Self and knows that there is nothing else but the Self. All this is one indivisible ocean of Sachidananda.",
      "When the mango is raw it is sour and bitter. But when it becomes ripe, it is sweet all over. Thus in the deluded state when man sees the manifold world, there is fear and hatred, and sorrow and suffering. But when all is seen as Atma, as God Himself, there can be no delusion, and when there is no delusion, there is no sorrow. Arjuna was deluded when he saw his relations and friends, and sorrow possessed him at the awful vision of their destruction on the battle-field. The Lord teaches him that he would never again be the victim of such delusion any time thereafter when he obtained Brahmajnana from the Master.",
      "The sine qua non of wisdom is freedom from delusion and any kind of attachment to sense pleasures. The Lord emphasised the need for practice and realisation and exposes the pretensions of those for whom religion is mere talk and verbal jugglery. It is practice that counts. The seeker should constantly examine himself: Am I free from delusion? Am I free from pride and arrogance? Am I free from envy towards other people’s fame and prosperity? Is there hatred and anger in me? How far have I overcome my sensual nature? In this way, everyone should thoroughly cleanse his mind day after day and purify the senses and the mind. There is no other way.The aspiration for the higher Self should be strengthened in order to overcome the desires of one’s lower nature. ‘Aim at the highest, do the best, and success is assured in due course.’ This is the Lord’s exhortation to all mankind in the Gita.",
      "(2) The second aspect of the Jnana is that the sage of steady wisdom is able to see the whole universe in his own Self and also in God. The whole universe with all its elements moving and unmoving is superimposed on Atma which is the basic Reality. When the rope is mistaken for a snake, what is the reality on which the delusion is based? The rope is the reality. So the snake which is superimposed by one’s delusion is not different from the rope. Even so, the super-imposed universe is not really different from Brahman. This being so, the wise man sees the entire world in the Self, Brahman. The mind is the creator of the universe, and the mind itself is in Atma, the Self. Even so, the mind and all that it creates is in the Self. ‘You are not in delusion. It is the delusion that is in you; all the worlds are in you and you are not in any world; all time is in you and you are not in any time, past, present or future.’ The Jnani has understood the Truth.",
      "Also in me:For the sage of steady wisdom, the Self, is the Lord Himself. And so what he sees in his Self, the same is seen in God also.",
      "‘The Jnani is Myself – says the Lord. There is no difference. This is the Advaitic realisation of the supreme Brahman. In that state, the devotee and God are one, and the disciple and the Guru are one. There is no second thing at all. It is all one indivisible absolute Reality.",
      "By seeing all beings in Self and God the sage becomes one with God. It cannot happen that the whole universe can be seen in two separate things. Self and God are one and the same. The man of Self-realisation is God Himself.",
      "Question:What is the fruit of obtaining Jnana?",

Enough it is if there is repentance and a determination to sin no more.",

In former births, out of ignorance, a man might have committed several kinds of sins, but all of them would be cleared when the light of knowledge dawns. Indeed man’s sins are compared to an ocean and Knowledge is rightly spoken of as the launch to cross the ocean. We have such examples of sinners turned into saints.

But Hanuman, trusting in Rama’s name, cleared the sea in one jump and reached the other side. He had no need of a bridge. (All laugh.) “Once a man was about to cross the sea. Bibhishana wrote Rama’s name on a leaf, tied it in a corner of the man’s wearing-cloth, and said to him: ‘Don’t be afraid. Have faith and walk on the water. But look here — the moment you lose faith you will be drowned.’ The man was walking easily on the water. Suddenly he had an intense desire to see what was tied in his cloth. He opened it and found only a leaf with the name of Rama written on it. ‘What is this?’ he thought. ‘Just the name of Rama!’ As soon as doubt entered his mind he sank under the water.",
      "“If a man has faith in God, then even if he has committed the most heinous sins — such as killing a cow, a brahmin, or a woman — he will certainly be saved through his faith.

      "There is no sorrow when there is no birth; there is no birth when there is no action, and there is no action when Knowledge is acquired. All actions done in the former state of ignorance are destroyed by the Knowledge now acquired. But this Knowledge should be perfect. Burning fire consumes all fuel thrown into it. The fire covered by ashes is simply extinguished if the wood is thrown over it. So the blazing fire of Knowledge destroys all actions.",
      "For the man who possessed knowledge and perceived Atma all actions are destroyed. In the formerverse, it is said that the ocean of sin is crossed over by the raft of Knowledge. Here it is further stated that all actions are destroyed by the fire of Knowledge.",
      "(To Keshab, with a smile)“Why is it that you are ill? There is a reason for it. Many spiritual feelings have passed through your body; therefore it has fallen ill. At the time an emotion is aroused, one understands very little about it. The blow that it delivers to the body is felt only after a long while. I have seen big steamers going by on the Ganges, at the time hardly noticing their passing. But oh, my! What a terrific noise is heard after a while, when the waves splash against the banks! Perhaps a piece of the bank breaks loose and falls into the water.“An elephant entering a hut creates havoc within and ultimately shakes it down. The elephant of divine emotion enters the hut of this body and shatters it to pieces.“Do you know what actually happens? When a house is on fire, at first a few things inside burn. Then comes the great commotion. Just so, the fire of Knowledge at first destroys such enemies of spiritual life as passion, anger, and so forth. Then comes the turn of ego. And lastly a violent commotion is seen in the physical frame.“You may think that everything is going to be over. But God will not release you as long as the slightest trace of your illness is left. You simply cannot leave the hospital if your name is registered there. As long as the illness is not perfectly cured, the doctor won’t give you a permit to go. Why did you register your name in the hospital at all?” (All laugh.)",
      "Keshab laughed again and again at the Master’s allusion to the hospital. Then Sri Ramakrishna spoke of his own illness. (To Keshab)-“Hriday used to say, ‘Never before have I seen such ecstasy for God, and never before have I seen such illness.’ I was then seriously ill with stubborn diarrhoea. It was as if millions of ants were gnawing at my brain. But all the same, spiritual talk went on day and night. Dr. Rama of Natagore was called in to see me. He found me discussing spiritual truth. ‘What a madman!’ he said. ‘Nothing is left of him but a few bones, and still he is reasoning like that!'”MASTER (to Keshab):“All depends on God’s will.",

      "There are many things pure in this world. Of them all, knowledge is the purest and the most perfect. Nothing can purify man except Knowledge. The impurity caused by ignorance is only cleansed by Knowledge. The physical body needs cleansing with water and soap every day. The subtle body also needs purification. And the purifying agents are Nishkama Karma, meditation, worship of God, and such other practices. Of them all, Knowledge is the best and greatest purifier.",
      "By oneself:Each individual has to find that Knowledge by himself. One should eat by himself to satisfy his hunger. One should take medicine by himself to cure his own disease. The Master provides all the help needed for the spiritual quest, but finally, each one should realise the Truth himself. There can be no proxy in Jnana. It is a direct personal experience.",
      "Perfected in Yoga:The man perfected in yoga obtains Knowledge. Nishkama Karma Yoga should become automatic, spontaneous, and natural. Then yoga is said to be perfect. The mind is purified of the taint of Selfishness and attachment to the gross material world. Then the man finds Knowledge.",
      "In Self:Where is this Knowledge? Is it in the sky or beyond the clouds? Is it in the other world? Or is it in the centre of the earth? – Where is this Knowledge? It is in the Self. All the time it has been there. Not knowing it man has been seeking it in the outside world, in temples, in rivers and mountains, and so on. After all this long search, man comes back to his own Self, and there he discovers that Knowledge which liberates him from sorrow and delusion. All knowledge, all perfection is already in the Self.",
      "In due season:The Lord answers the question when this Knowledge becomes manifest. In due season, this Knowledge which is already in the Self reveals itself, and then the endless wanderings of the mind stop forever. There is no time limit for this supreme revelation. When the mind becomes pure, Knowledge comes of its own accord. Sooner or later this Knowledge should manifest itself, the time taken depending on the ripeness of the individual. No one needs to be discouraged that he has not got it immediately. As he continues the spiritual Sadhana, the mind gradually drops off its taints and blemishes and Truth is seen and known. The plant of spirituality should be watered and taken care of in every way. Sincerity and earnestness are essential. By God’s grace Knowledge is revealed to the aspirant.",
      "It has been said that adversity is the touchstone of true knowledge, and this may be said a hundred times with regard to the truth: “Thou art That.” This truly diagnoses the vairagya (dispassion) disease. Blessed is the life of one who has developed this symptom. In spite of your dislike I repeat the old saying: “Wait for a short time.” You are tired with rowing; rest on your oars.

    ],
    "commentary": [
      "Three qualities are mentioned here for gaining Knowledge.",
      "(1)The man of faith:Faith is the seed of success even in worldly matters. The degree of faith in the Sastras and the teaching of the Guru, determine the degree of success. The greater the faith the sooner the success. The seeker should do the prescribed Sadhana with deep faith and it would surely lead him to spiritual illumination. Doubt will not bear any fruit what-so-ever. Doubt is the very negation of faith and want of faith results in utter failure. That is why the Lord insists on faith as an indispensable condition for the aspirant. The sick man should have faith in the physician and the medicine prescribed by him. Otherwise, the efficacy of the medicine is neutralised by the negative attitude of the patient. As the Sadhaka practises the discipline sincerely at first, he would gain some simple spiritual experience, which would confirm his faith in the higher laws of spirituality.It should be understood that Faith is not a denial of one’s reason and judgment. What is implied is that the seeker should carry out the instructions of the Sastras and the Gure in the full hope that they would yield the best results. And when he knows by experience the value of faith, his progress becomes quicker and smoother. So one should have faith in his spiritual destiny.",
      "(2)Having Knowledge as the supreme goal:The aspirant should have single-minded devotion to the spiritual ideal. There should not be any discordant note in the general harmony of word, thought and deed. One may talk of spirituality and yet his thoughts may be plunged in gross worldliness, and his deeds may be utterly sensual. Such a split personality cannot make any progress in any direction. Divided aims and distracted minds achieve nothing. The personality of man, complete and entire, should be dedicated to the spiritual aim. He should fully realise within himself that there is no other goal to strive for. Naturally, by discrimination, when it is known that all other things are painful perishable worthless stuff, the spiritual aim alone shines as a perfect star. Then Self-realisation becomes possible.",
      "(3)Of controlled senses:Faith and single-minded devotion to the divine aim should be accompanied with systematic practice of sense-restraint. Faith and aspiration may do much, but for perfection in Jnana, the senses should be brought under control. So long as the mind runs after material objects through the channels of the senses, wisdom cannot be found. The attempt is to turn the mind inwards. The sense-organs by their very nature function by attaching themselves to some physical object or other. The mind is linked to the senses, and so the mind runs out. This link should be cut, and the mind should be trained to look inward. Then the senses can do nothing. They remain powerless in their places. So sense-control is prescribed as the third characteristic of the man of Knowledge.",
      "What is the fruit of this Knowledge? Peace, Supreme Peace (Param santim adhigacchati). Swiftly the wise man attains peace. Everyone is seeking peace and happiness. But it is eluding him. He seeks it in worldly pleasures and possessions. But he does not find it in them. So he is restless and distracted. Where is that peace? The Lord answers the question. Peace is in the Knowledge of Atma, and nowhere else. Every little satisfaction which one desires from small pleasures and successes here and there in the world are only shadows of the real peace of the Self. So let all people go to the very source of Peace – Atma. Having thus described the excellence of Jnana, the Lord concludes that it leads to Supreme Peace.",
      "Question:Who can attain Jnana?",
      "Answer:The man of faith, devotion, and self-control attains Knowledge.",
      "Question:What is the fruit of Jnana?",
      "Answer:Peace.",

      "So the Lord exhorts the seeker to work with faith, diligence, and determination. He should be filled with self-confidence and perfect faith in the Sastras and the Guru. Such a man attains spiritual progress and realisation.",
      "Likewise the education that our boys receive is very negative. The schoolboy learns nothing, but has everything of his own broken down — want of shraddha is the result. The shraddha which is the keynote of the Veda and the Vedanta — the shraddha which emboldened Nachiketa to face Yama and question him, through which shraddha this world moves — the annihilation of that shraddha! “The ignorant, the man devoid of shraddha, the doubting self runs to ruin.” Therefore are we so near to destruction.

      "Sri Ramakrishna, who could read a man’s inmost thought, said: “One doesn’t lose consciousness by thinking of Him who is all Spirit, all Consciousness. Shivanath once remarked that too much thinking about God confounds the brain. Thereupon I said to him, ‘How can one become unconscious by thinking of Consciousness?'”M:“Yes, sir, I realise that. It isn’t like thinking of an unreal object. How can a man lose his intelligence if he always fixes his mind on Him whose very nature is eternal Intelligence?”MASTER (with pleasure):“It is through God’s grace that you understand that. The doubts of the mind will not disappear without His grace. Doubts do not disappear without Self-realisation.“But one need not fear anything if one has received the grace of God. It is rather easy for a child to stumble if he holds his father’s hand; but there can be no such fear if the father holds the child’s hand.A man does not have to suffer any more if God, in His grace, removes his doubts and reveals Himself to him. But this grace descends upon him only after he has prayed to God with intense yearning of heart and practised spiritual discipline.The mother feels compassion for her child when she sees him running about breathlessly. She has been hiding herself; now she appears before the child.”“But why should God make us run about?” thought M.Immediately Sri Ramakrishna said: “It is His will that we should run about a little. Then it is great fun. God has created the world in play, as it were. This is called Mahamaya, the Great Illusion. Therefore one must take refuge in the Divine Mother, the Cosmic Power Itself. It is She who has bound us with the shackles of illusion. The realisation of God is possible only when those shackles are severed.” (Source:Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna)",
