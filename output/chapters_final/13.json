      "Arjuna now questions the Lord about the attributeless Brahma. In the Gita, the first six chapters (1-6) are known as ‘Karmashtakam‘ dealing with karma yoga; the second six chapters (7-12) are known as ‘Bhaktishtakam‘ dealing with ‘Bhakti‘, and the last six chapters (13-18) are known as ‘Jnanashatakam‘ dealing with ‘Jnana‘. So in this Discourse, the subject of knowledge is taken up for detailed investigation. For the aspirant in the ‘Jnanamarga’, this Discourse is of great importance.",
      "Question:What is Arjuna’s question?",
      "Answer:He desires to know ‘Prakriti’ and ‘Purusha’, ‘Kshetra’ and ‘Kshetrajna’, ‘Jnana’ and ‘Jneya’.",
      "* In some editions of the Bhagavad Gita, this verse has been omitted, and the next verse figures as the first verse of the thirteenth chapter."

    "commentary": [
      "‘Kshetram‘ means field. The field is necessary for growing corn and other things to sustain the beings of the world. So also the body is necessary for the growth of the seed of knowledge in the heart of man. All ‘sadhana’, ‘tapas’, thinking and meditation – all this is to be done with the body. So the body, the ‘kshetra’, is the field for the growth of the, seed of ‘Dharma’ as well as ‘Jnana’. Therefore it is called ‘kshetra’.",
      "The body being inert (Jada’) does not know itself; There is a consciousness within with power to cognise the body. This consciousness power is known as ‘kshetrajna.’ He is ‘Pratyagatma’. He is the witness of the combined elements of the body, senses and the mind. He is changeless, pure, intelligence, deathless, separate from the five sheaths (Panchakosas). What is inert cannot know itself. The wall does not know that it is a wall, nor does a pot know that it is a pot. It is intelligence that has the power of cognition. That Intelligence is the Knower of the body. He knows. He (‘kshetrajna‘) is pure Intelligence.",
      "The knower of the field is certainly different from the field. So the knower of the body should certainly be distinct from the body. Though Intelligence is in the body, yet it remains free and perfect, witnessing the modifications of the body and mind during all the three states of wakefulness ‘Jagrat’, dream ‘Svapna’ and sleep ‘Sushupti’.",
      "Question:What is Kshetra?",
      "Answer:This body, this vehicle (Upadhi) is the Kshetra.",
      "Question:Who is the kshetrajna?",
      "Answer:Pure Intelligence (Pratyagatma) is the knower of the field."

      "In this verse, the Lord teaches the Mahavakya ‘tat tvam asi’ (Thou art That). In theSecond Discoursein the verse‘Na tvevaham jatu nasam’(2.12), the Lord has already taught the Mahavakya, the highest truth. The Jiva is no other than Siva. The Jiva (really Pratyagatman) is the Knower of the field, the witness to the modifications of the body and mind, and this Jiva is not distinct from Paramatma, is actually one with Him. “Know Me as the Knower of the body in all the bodies”. So the Jiva who is the Knower in a particular body is Paramatma Himself, who is also the knower in everybody. There is therefore only one Knower and He is functioning in everybody as the witness. The Lord Himself is the Knower in all the bodies. The ‘Jiva’ is only a fictitious entity and has no real existence at all apart from the Lord. To know this Truth fully and finally is the highest achievement of man.",
      "This knowledge gives to every man the greatest strength and courage. Why should one weep and wail? Why should he suffer the miseries of life? Let him remember that the Lord is actually, directly present in him. This is the truth. No other kind of knowledge except this can give man supreme joy and blissfulness. Knowledge of the sciences, arts and politics, is incomplete and one-sided. There is no perfection in them. There is no finality in them. They keep man where he is. This knowledge of the kshetrajna transforms man into a Divine Being. He understands the tremendous mystery of the human personality.",
      "Sarvakshetreshu:Lord Krishna declares Himself to be Paramatma present in every being. He is the basis, the foundation of all. In all human beings irrespective of caste, creed, race, sex and nationality, and in all animals, reptiles and worms, in every body the Lord is present as the One Cognising Power. All the rest is ‘Jada’, except the Lord.",
      "The splendid declaration of the Lord should be thought of, meditated upon, and realised by every seeker.",
      "Question:Who is it that functions as the Cognising Intelligence in all bodies?",
      "Answer:He is Lord Himself, Paramatma.",
      "Question:Where does then Paramatma exist?",
      "Answer:He exists in the heart of every being, as the eternal witness.",
      "Question:Does He exist in certain bodies only?",
      "Answer:No. In all kshetras,- man, animal, bird, reptile etc., he exists.",
      "Question:What is the nature of the Lord?",
      "Answer:He is not a ‘jada’, or nothingness. He is pure intelligence. So He is the one kshetrajna in all beings.",
      "Question:What is true Knowledge in the world?",
      "Answer:That knowledge which enables man to distinguish the body from the knower of the body, the ‘Drik’ from the ‘Drishya’ is true knowledge – That is the Lord’s declaration."

Thus when the mind is purified by spiritual qualities, the Self is clearly reflected in it. So the seeker has to cultivate these qualities of jnanam first, and the self-existent Paramatman is revealed spontaneously without any effort on the part of man. All effort, all practice, all ‘sadhana’ is needed to purify the mind by the acquisition of these moral and spiritual qualities. There ends all effort. The Realisation of Paramatman occurs by itself. No effort is needed. Twenty spiritual qualities are mentioned here. The seeker has to understand each one of them and make them all part of his own personality.",

      "In this Discourse, both knowledge and the object of Knowledge are explained. The moral and spiritual qualities needed for Self-realisation are stated as Knowledge (Jnanam) here. Without perfect command of these qualities, no one can attain Paramatma. When the mirror is pure, the reflection is clear, not otherwise. Thus when the mind is purified by spiritual qualities, the Self is clearly reflected in it. So the seeker has to cultivate these qualities of jnanam first, and the self-existent Paramatman is revealed spontaneously without any effort on the part of man. All effort, all practice, all ‘sadhana’ is needed to purify the mind by the acquisition of these moral and spiritual qualities. There ends all effort. The Realisation of Paramatman occurs by itself. No effort is needed. Twenty spiritual qualities are mentioned here. The seeker has to understand each one of them and make them all part of his own personality.",

    "commentary": [
      "In this Discourse, both knowledge and the object of Knowledge are explained. The moral and spiritual qualities needed for Self-realisation are stated as Knowledge (Jnanam) here. Without perfect command of these qualities, no one can attain Paramatma. When the mirror is pure, the reflection is clear, not otherwise. Thus when the mind is purified by spiritual qualities, the Self is clearly reflected in it. So the seeker has to cultivate these qualities of jnanam first, and the self-existent Paramatman is revealed spontaneously without any effort on the part of man. All effort, all practice, all ‘sadhana’ is needed to purify the mind by the acquisition of these moral and spiritual qualities. There ends all effort. The Realisation of Paramatman occurs by itself. No effort is needed. Twenty spiritual qualities are mentioned here. The seeker has to understand each one of them and make them all part of his own personality.",
      "acharyopasanam:Service to the Guru is an essential factor in spiritual life. Without the benediction of God and Guru, no advancement is possible. Knowledge of Atma is attained by their grace. (4.34)",
      "saucham:Purity both internal and external is another essential factor of spiritual life. The mind and body should be washed clean of all their dirt and foul passions.",
      "sthairyam:The seeker should be firm, determined and resolute. His decision should be unalterable. The views and opinions of worldly men should not be allowed to loosen the firmness of one’s own conviction about spiritual truth.",
      "atmavinigrahah:Here the word Atman stands for senses and mind. They should be thoroughly brought under control, without any fear of rebellion from them at any time. The power of Maya can easily trap up a man, if his self-control is partial or inadequate.",
      "indriyartheshu vairagyam:Dispassion for sense-objects is the test of a jnani. The man of knowledge is never tempted by the attractions of the sense-world. If the mind runs after sense pleasures, it cannot be brought to rest in the Self. Meditation is not possible. The seeker has to develop ‘vairagya’ as the very life element of spiritual progress. He should turn the mind inwards to look into the Self by withdrawing it from its usual wanderings in the objective world.",
      "janmamrityu jaravyadhi dukha doshanudarsanam:Generally people are able to understand the evils of old age, disease and death. But they do not understand the evils of birth. When a child is born people feel happy. But the Lord here says that birth itself is evil and sorrowful. Because all the ensuing ills and miseries of life come after birth. When there is no birth, there is no body; when there is no body there is no old age or disease or death. That is why both birth and death are said to form the cycle of ‘samsara’. The man who desires to escape death, should also avoid birth. One cannot be had without the other. The true aspirant thinks deeply and sees clearly (anudarsanam) all the evils arising from material life. By such contemplation, he develops a deep inspiration to transcend these evils by every means possible. He finds ultimately that he is not the body, but Atma, the unborn and deathless, free from all the modifications of body and mind. Thus he transcends death. This habit of the mind to see the evils of life and death is of utmost importance in the path of knowledge.",
      "asaktir anabhishvangah putradaragrihadishu:The house-holders should think of this aspect of jnana. He should understand that these things like wife and children, positions and possessions, do not really belong to him. It does not mean that he should abandon them. The idea is that there should not be any mental attachment for them. He should realise that he has nothing to do with them, though externally he discharges all the duties of a house-holder.",
      "samachittatvam:Equanimity of mind under all circumstances is again the essence of jnana. The wise man is constant and steady whatever may happen, because he knows that he is not the kshetra, but the kshetrajna. So he is indifferent to joy or sorrow, good fortune or ill-fate.",
      "bhaktiravyabhicharini:The Lord mentions devotion to Him as one of the qualities of Knowledge. This devotion should be constant and continuous, and it should not be diverted toward any other object in the world. Though in the beginning, such single-minded devotion is not possible, yet by resolute practice he should attain that state when the mind rests steadfast in the Lord and does not move away from Him.",
      "viviktadesa sevitvam:In the early stages the company of worldly-minded people causes great distraction (vikshepa), and so the seeker is required to resort to solitary places for silent thinking and meditation. It is quite possible to create such silence and solitude in one’s own house by keeping a room separately for purposes of study and meditation. As the seeker advances, he takes to silence and solitude naturally.",
      "aratirjanasamsadi:The company of indifferent people should be avoided. ‘Satsang‘ is always desirable.",
      "adhyatmajnana nityatvam:Constancy of Divine contemplation and knowledge is taught here. The light of knowledge should be steady and bright in the heart always. If the light is extinguished, darkness immediately envelops the heart of man. When jnana is lost, ajnana enters at once. When ajnana is put off, jnana dawns at once. They are like light and darkness. When the one is, the other is not. The seekers should remember the Lord’s instruction and try to be aware of the truth at all times. Such awareness keeps off ‘avidya’ from possessing the heart of man.",
      "tatvajnanartha darsanam:Direct experience of the truth is one of the important qualities of a jnani. It is not speculation or logic or argument, but actual perception of Atma, which is Brahmajnana.",
      "ajnanam yadatonyatha:What is igorance? What is not jnana is ignorance. The Lord need not explain what ignorance is. Everybody knows it already. Pride and arrogance, selfishness, envy and jealousy, ill-will, hatred and a host of evil passions, desires, hopes and fears which beset the mind constitue ignorance.",
      "(To Amrita and Trailokya) “Youngsters like Narendra and Rakhal are ever-perfect. Every time they are born they are devoted to God. An ordinary man acquires a little devotion after austerities and a hard struggle. But these boys have love of God from the very moment of their birth. They are like the natural image of Siva, which springs forth from the earth and is not set up by human hands.",
      "“The ever-perfect form a class by themselves. Not all birds have crooked beaks. The ever-perfect are never attached to the world. There is the instance of Prahlada.",
      "“Ordinary people practise spiritual discipline and cultivate devotion to God; but they also become attached to the world and are caught in the clamour of ‘woman and gold’. They are like flies, which sit on a flower or a sweetmeat and light on filth as well.",
      "“But the ever-perfect are like bees, which light only on flowers and sip the honey. The ever-perfect drink only the Nectar of Divine Bliss. They are never inclined to worldly pleasures.(Mam EvaBG 7.14)",
      "“The devotion of the ever-perfect is not like the ordinary devotion that one acquires as a result of strenuous spiritual discipline. Ritualistic devotion consists in repeating the name of God and performing worship in a prescribed manner. It is like crossing a rice-field in a roundabout way along the balk. Again, it is like reaching a near-by village by boat in a roundabout way along a winding river.",
      "“One does not follow the injunctions of ceremonial worship when one develops raga-bhakti, when one loves God as one’s own. Then it is like crossing a rice-field after the harvest. You don’t have to walk along the balk. You can go straight across the field in any direction.",
      "“When the country is flooded deep with water, one doesn’t have to follow the winding river. Then the fields are deep under water. You can row your boat straight to the village.",
      "“Without this intense attachment, this passionate love, one cannot realise God.”",
      "AMRITA:“Sir, how do you feel in samadhi?”",
      "MASTER:“You may have heard that the cockroach, by intently meditating on the brahmara, is transformed into a brahmara. Do you know how I feel then? I feel like a fish released from a pot into the water of the Ganges.”",
      "AMRITA:“Don’t you feel at that time even a trace of ego?”",
      "MASTER:“Yes, generally a little of it remains. However hard you may rub a grain of gold against a grindstone, still a bit of it always remains. Or again, take the case of a big fire; the ego is like one of its sparks. In samadhi I lose outer consciousness completely; but God generally keeps a little trace of ego in me for the enjoyment of divine communion. Enjoyment is possible only when ‘I’ and ‘you’ remain.",
      "“Again, sometimes God effaces even that trace of ‘I’. Then one experiences jada samadhi or nirvikalpa samadhi. That experience cannot be described. A salt doll went to measure the depth of the ocean, but before it had gone far into the water it melted away. It became entirely one with the water of the ocean. Then who was to come back and tell the ocean’s depth?” (Source:Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna)",
      "—–",
      "MASTER:“You talk glibly about prema. But is it such a commonplace thing? There are two characteristics of prema.First, it makes one forget the world.So intense is one’s love of God that one becomes unconscious of outer things. Chaitanya had this ecstatic love; he ‘took a wood for the sacred grove of Vrindavan and the ocean for the dark waters of the Jamuna’.Second, one has no feeling of ‘my-ness’ toward the body, which is so dear to man.One wholly gets rid of the feeling that the body is the soul.",
      "“There are certain signs of God-realisation. The man in whom longing for God manifests its glories is not far from attaining Him. What are the glories of that longing? They are discrimination, dispassion, compassion for living beings, serving holy men, loving their company, chanting the name and glories of God, telling the truth, and the like. When you see those signs of longing in an aspirant, you can rightly say that for him the vision of God is not far to seek.“The state of a servant’s house will tell you unmistakably whether his master has decided to visit it. First, the rubbish and jungle around the house are cleared up. Second, the soot and dirt are removed from the rooms. Third, the courtyard, floors, and other places are swept clean. Finally the master himself sends various things to the house, such as a carpet, a hubble-bubble for smoking, and the like. When you see these things arriving, you conclude that the master will very soon come.”A DEVOTEE:“Sir, should one first practise discrimination to attain self-control?”MASTER:“That is also a path. It is called the path of vichara, reasoning. But the inner organs (Mind (manas), intelligence (buddhi), mind-stuff (chitta), and ego (ahamkara).) are brought under control naturally through the path of devotion as well. It is rather easily accomplished that way. Sense pleasures appear more and more tasteless as love for God grows. Can carnal pleasure attract a grief-stricken man and woman the day their child has died?”",
      "DEVOTEE:“How can I develop love for God?”MASTER:“Repeat His name, and sins will disappear. Thus you will destroy lust, anger, the desire for creature comforts, and so on.”DEVOTEE:“How can I take delight in God’s name?”MASTER:“Pray to God with a yearning heart that you may take delight in His name. He will certainly fulfil your heart’s desire.”So saying, the Master sang a song in his sweet voice, pleading with the Divine Mother to show Her grace to suffering men:",

      "Question:What are the qualities of a Jnani and how many are they?",
      "Answer:They are twenty – 1. Absence of self-glorification, 2. absence of pretention, 3. non injury, 4. fortitude, 5. uprightness, 6. service to teacher 7. purity, 8. firmness, 9. self control, 10. dispassion towards sense-objects 11. absence of egoism, 12. remembrance of the evils and sorrows of birth, death, old age and pain, 13. non-attachment, 14. non-identification with sons, wife, house etc., 15. constant equal-mindedness during desirable and undesirable occurrences, 16. unswerving devotion to the Lord by the yoga of non-separation, 17. resorting to solitary places, 18. distaste for the society of men, 19. constancy of Self-knowledge. 20. perception of the true end of knowledge. These are the qualities of a jnani."

    "commentary": [
      "From this verse onwards in six verses, the Lord explains the nature of that which is to be known, the supreme Brahman. The formerverses (8-12)dealt with knowledge and its qualities. But that is not enough. Knowledge of what? What is it that the man of wisdom knows? What does knowledge lead to? What is that to be known? These questions are answered now by the Lord. Having abandoned bad qualities, the aspirant acquires good qualities, and then abandoning both, he attains the supreme Brahman. This is the state of perfection. All the other states are imperfect.",
      "Some of the religions are content with the teaching of ethical principles and a moral code of conduct. It is good in itself, but that is not enough. The aspirant should purify himself by ethical conduct, and then find his identity with the Supreme. That is the ultimate goal. There is no resting ground anywhere below that state. Therefore in the Gita, the Lord takes his disciple to the highest rung of the spiritual ladder and leaves him there – the Advaita realisation of Nirguna Brahman. The Gita explains Dvaita Visishtadvaita and Advaita one after another and so it is said to be the one complete spiritual Sastra.",
      "Pravakshyami:The enthusiasm of the Lord in this spiritual teaching is indicated by this word.",
      "Amritam asnute:The reward of the Brahman is stated even at the beginning – the reward is Immortality. Knowing this, the seeker is inspired with zeal to move forward towards the goal – Immortality, Moksha, Perfection! That is the reward. Why should man cling to wretched perishable stuff and exhaust his precious life in animal activities, when there is Perfection awaiting him at the end of this ‘sadhana’?",
      "nasaduchyate:The supreme Brahman is not an object of sense-perception. That is the idea of ‘na sat’ (non existence). It does not mean that it has non existence. A body exists and when it dies it ceases to exist. This is true of all objects. But Brahman is not said to exist or not exist in this sense. It is beyond existence and non-existence.",
      "At four o’clock in the afternoon Mr. Mukherji, a relative of Prankrishna, arrived in the company of a brahmin well versed in the scriptures.MUKHERJI:“I am very happy to meet you, sir.”MASTER:“God dwells in all beings. He is the gold in all. In some places it is more clearly manifest than in others. God dwells in the worldly-minded, no doubt, but He is hidden there, like gold under deep layers of clay.”MUKHERJI:“Sir, what is the difference between worldly and other-worldly things?”",
      "MASTER:“While striving for the realisation of God, the aspirant has to practise renunciation, applying the logic of ‘Neti, neti’ — ‘Not this, not this’.But after attaining the vision of God, he realises that God alone has become all things.“At one time Rama was overpowered by the spirit of renunciation. Dasaratha, worried at this, went to the sage Vasishtha and begged him to persuade Rama not to give up the world. The sage came to Rama and found him in a gloomy mood. The fire of intense renunciation had been raging in the Prince’s mind. Vasishtha said: ‘Rama, why should You renounce the world? Is the world outside God? Reason with me.’ Rama realised that the world had evolved from the Supreme Brahman. So He said nothing.“Buttermilk is made from the same substance as butter. One who realises this knows that butter goes with buttermilk and buttermilk with butter. After separating the butter with great effort — that is to say, after attaining Brahmajnana — you will realise that as long as butter exists, buttermilk also must exist. Wherever there is butter there must be buttermilk as well. As long as one feels that Brahman exists, one must also be aware that the universe, living beings, and the twenty-four cosmic principles exist as well.",
      "“What Brahman is cannot be described in words. Everything has been polluted, like food that has touched the tongue — that is, everything has been described in words. But no one has been able to describe Brahman. It is therefore unpolluted. I said this to Vidyasagar and he was delighted.“But the Knowledge of Brahman cannot be realised if the aspirant is worldly-minded even in the slightest degree. He succeeds in acquiring this Knowledge only when his mind is totally free from ‘woman and gold’. Parvati once said to Her father, ‘Father, seek the company of holy men if you want the Knowledge of Brahman.'” (Source:Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna)"

      "Madbhakta etad vijnaya:It is clear from this that no one, unless he is the devotee of Lord, can attain that knowledge which makes him fit to become one with the Supreme Being. It is only from the flower of devotion that the fruit of knowledge grows. Therefore every seeker has to acquire God’s grace and Guru’s benediction by virtuous acts, by worship, by japa, tapas, by singing the name and glory of the Lord and by following all the aids to pure devotion. Then, out of compassion, He bestows on His Bhakta the ‘buddhiyoga‘ which enables him to distinguish the kshetra and kshetrajna. This knowledge leads him to become one with Paramatma (Madbhavaya). One may become a great scholar of the Sastras and Sciences, but he cannot obtain knowledge of the Divine if there is no devotion. Learning and realisation are entirely different. They are poles apart. Let the seekers move forward on the path of devotion, and let them gradually gain the intellectual purity to understand the final Truth. Moksha is the fruit of perfect knowledge of the kshetra and kshetrajna. And this knowledge is offered to the true devotee by the Lord Himself.",

      "Many ask the question “When did this samsara, bondage, maya, begin ?” – It would be difficult for the sleeper to say when a dream has started during sleep. This world also is of the same nature. It is beginningless. If one enters a mountain-cave full of darkness, he cannot say how long the darkness has been there. Therefore it is said that this Maya, Prakriti, is beginningless (anadi). No one can say when it began. But it has not been said that it is endless(anantam). If it is endless also, no one can cross over. Maya has no beginning, but it has an end. The moment knowledge dawns on man, it ends. The illusion is shattered, the moment Truth is seen. The dream-world may be beginningless, but the moment one wakes up it is all gone. True Knowledge then removes delusion forever. So Prakriti has no beginning but has an end; Purusha is beginningless and endless. He is eternal.",
      "Prakriti sambhavan:Purusha is ever pure (Nityasuddha). There cannot be any change or modification in Him. Desire, hatred, pleasure and pain all these arise from Prakriti. As long as these passions agitate the mind, it is clear to everyone that he is subject to the power of Maya, that he is still in the realm of kshetra and has not attained the kshetrajna. These ‘vasanas,’ having come to man from endless births, should be cleared by determined effort, and he should reach the Purusha in due course. Whenever the mind is agitated by these passions, whenever the intellect becomes clouded, one should firmly assert and affirm that he is the Purusha, changeless, pure and perfect. He should keep himself alert and apart, and watch these modifications as objective changes in the outside world with which he is not at all concerned. He should remain firm and immovable like the mountain. That is the way to overcome the past ‘samskaras’; there is no other way."

    "commentary": [
      "This verse explains the cause for the birth of the Jiva in good and evil wombs. The cause for it is the attachment of the Jiva with qualities (sattva, rajas and tamas) and the various objects of the material world. This is the cause of bondage though the Jiva (Purusha) is really the Drik (seer), yet he is deluded into thinking that he is the objective body, and by the delusion, he attaches himself to the objective world through a sense of ‘I’ and ‘mine’, through ‘raga’ and ‘dvesha’. Thus he becomes bound and takes birth after birth in the world. He becomes a ‘samsari’ by binding himself to ‘samsara’. Therefore the wise man should know that attachment to the Gunas is the cause of birth and all the evils arising from it. He should cut off all contact with the Gunas, and the vehicle of the body; and he should not have any feeling of ‘myness’, regarding the body and its modifications. He should positively contemplate that He is ever free, pure consciousness, till by such contemplation, he releases himself from the shackles of the body and the Gunas relating to it. He then knows what he really is the eternally pure and perfect Purusha. This is the only way to go beyond the ocean of samsara, the series of births and deaths which one suffers. Attahment is bondage, detachment is freedom.",

If the mainspring of a watch is cut off, all the other wheels stop moving. Thus if the contact with the body and the Gunas of Prakriti is given up completely, the whole series of births and deaths come to end, and that very moment man attains freedom and perfection.",
      "Ashu Mitra wrote about an interesting event: “Once we printed some photos of Holy Mother (size 12″ x 15″) from the studio of a European photographer. I gave one copy to the Mother to see; she took it with both hands and then touched it with her forehead. Seeing her childlike action, I suppressed my laughter. When she returned the photo, I asked her, ‘Mother, whose photo is this?’ Like a simple girl, she replied: ‘Why? It is my picture.’ I laughed. She asked, ‘Why are you laughing?’ I replied, ‘Why did you salute it by touching it to your head?’ She also laughed and finally said,‘The Master also dwells in it.’” (Source: Sri Sarada Devi and Her Divine Play)",
      "Question:What is the cause of birth?",
      "Answer:The attachment of the ‘Jiva’ with the vehicle of the body, and the ‘Gunas’ caused by ‘Prakriti’ is the cause of birth.",

The male and female cannot live separately. Wherever Purusha is, there is Prakriti, and wherever Prakriti is, there is Purusha.”It was Vijaya day. Sri Ramakrishna asked Dr. Sarkar to have some refreshments. The devotees served him with sweets.DOCTOR (while eating):“Now I say ‘Thank you’ for the sweets; but it is not for your teachings. Why should I give that ‘Thank you’ in words?”MASTER (smiling):“The essential thing is to fix the mind on God and to practise meditation a little. What more shall I say? (Pointing to the younger Naren) Look at him. His mind totally merges in God. Those things I was telling you —”DOCTOR:“Tell the others also.”MASTER:“No, a man should be given food according to his power of digestion. Can all understand what I told you? I cannot talk to everyone as I talked to you. Suppose a mother has bought a fish for the family. All her children have not the same power of digestion. For some she makes pilau and for others she makes stew. These latter have weak stomachs.” (All laugh.) (Source:Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna)",

      "Swami Turiyananda was very frank and truthful. But his candour in pointing out a person’s defects often proved painful. One day he came across this verse of the Bhagavata:“Realizing the universe as one in the aspect of Purusha and prakriti, never praise or blame the action of others”(11. 28. 1). Then he read the commentary on that verse: “If accidentally the teeth bite the tongue, hurt and cut it, do people take a piece of stone and break the teeth? No, because the teeth belong to the same person to whom the tongue belongs. Since the one Lord who is in me also resides in others, it is improper to find fault with them.” This teaching made a deep impression on Turiyananda; thereafter, he became gentler in correcting those in his charge.

His eyes were luminous; his whole frame seemed alive with some strange spiritual consciousness. Pointing to the sannyasins and brahmacharins about him, he exclaimed [to Sharat Chandra]:And where will you go to seek Brahman? He is immanent in all beings. Here, here is the visible Brahman! Shame on those who, disregarding the visible Brahman, set their minds on other things! Here is the Brahman before you as tangible as a fruit in your hand! Can’t you see! Here — here — here is the Brahman!”He spoke these words in such an inspiring way, that over all present there came the peace and insight of deep meditation. They stood like marble statues, so motionless and hushed in silence had they become! Swami Premananda, after his bath in the Ganges, was on his way to the shrine for worship. Hearing the words of his brother monk he fell into a state of ecstasy and became motionless. After a quarter of an hour the swami said to him, “Now go for worship.” Then only did Premananda regain normal consciousness. That scene was unforgettable. Everyone in the monastery was struck with amazement at the power of the beloved Leader who, with a word, could raise the minds of all present to the heights of the transcendental realm …",

      "Samam, sarvatra, samavasthitam:These three words show that the Lord is (1) equally present, (2) is in all beings (3) and is the same. The wise man who realises Atma in this way does not destroy the Self with the self. What is meant is that the ignorant man destroys the Self by identifying himself with the body. In fact, this amounts to suicide (Atmahatya). The Lord shows how the ignorant man, thinking of himself as the non-Self, is destroying his true Self. Generally, what does the common man see and think? He sees the body and the world externally, си and thinks that he is the body. What happens then? The true Self is as good as having been destroyed because its existence is not known or realised. The wise man sees and realises the true Self, and so the does not care for the death of the body and the other vehicles covering the Atma. He knows that he is the immortal Self. But the ignorant not knowing this go through the wheel of suffering and death endlessly. They take birth after birth and die again and again. The brief interval of life is a horrible dream of sorrow and misery. This is the so-called life that man clings to desperately.",
      "Therefore the seeker should be constantly in contact with the Self, Paramatma, who exists equally in all beings. This Self is universal and exists everywhere, also in one’s own heart. This Knowledge and realisation lead the aspirant to the highest goal (Moksha). There is no state higher than freedom and perfection for any man anywhere.",
      "Ay, if there is anything in the Gita that I like, it is these two verses (BG 13.28,BG 13.29), coming out strong as the very gist, the very essence, of Krishna’s teaching — “He who sees the Supreme Lord dwelling alike in all beings, the Imperishable in things that perish, he sees indeed. For seeing the Lord as the same, everywhere present, he does not destroy the Self by the Self, and thus he goes to the highest goal.” Thus there is a great opening for the Vedanta to do beneficent work both here and elsewhere. This wonderful idea of the sameness and omnipresence of the Supreme Soul has to be preached for the amelioration and elevation of the human race here as elsewhere. Wherever there is evil and wherever there is ignorance and want of knowledge, I have found out by experience that all evil comes, as our scriptures say, relying upon differences, and that all good comes from faith in equality, in the underlying sameness and oneness of things. This is the great Vedantic ideal.[Source]",
      "“Thus seeing the same Lord equally present everywhere, the sage does not injure the Self by the self, and thus reaches the highest goal.”[Source]",
      "This is the bane of human nature, the curse upon mankind, the root of all misery — this inequality. This is the source of all bondage, physical, mental, and spiritual. “Since seeing the Lord equally existent everywhere, he injures not Self by self, and so goes to the Highest Goal.” This one saying contains, in a few words, the universal way to salvation.[Source]",
      "Why do you fear to weep? Weep! Weeping clears the eyes and brings about intuition. Then the vision of diversity — man, animal, tree — slowly melting away, makes room for the infinite realization of Brahman everywhere and in every thing. Then “Verily, seeing the same God equally existent everywhere, he does not injure the Self by the self, and so goes to the Supreme Goal”.[Source]",
      "Therefore the absolute sameness of conditions, if that be the aim of ethics, appears to be impossible. That all men should be the same, could never be, however we might try. Men will be born differentiated; some will have more power than others; some will have natural capacities, others not; some will have perfect bodies, others not. We can never stop that. At the same time ring in our ears the wonderful words of morality proclaimed by various teachers: “Thus, seeing the same God equally present in all, the sage does not injure Self by the self, and thus reaches the highest goal. Even in this life they have conquered relative existence whose minds are firmly fixed on this sameness; for God is pure, and God is the same to all. Therefore such are said to be living in God.” We cannot deny that this is the real idea; yet at the same time comes the difficulty that the sameness as regards external forms and position can never be attained.[Source]",
      "But yet, at the same time, even the idea of the body disappears where the mind itself becomes finer and finer, till it has almost disappeared, when all the different things that make us fear, make us weak, and bind us down to this body-life have disappeared. Then and then alone one finds out the truth of that grand old teaching. What is the teaching? “Even in this life they have conquered the round of birth and death whose minds are firm-fixed on the sameness of everything, for God is pure and the same to all, and therefore such are said to be living in God.” “Thus seeing the Lord the same everywhere, he, the sage, does not hurt the Self by the self, and so goes to the highest goal.”[Source]",
      "Advaita and Advaita alone explains morality. Every religion preaches that the essence of all morality is to do good to others. And why? Be unselfish. And why should I? Some God has said it? He is not for me. Some texts have declared it? Let them; that is nothing to me; let them all tell it. And if they do, what is it to me? Each one for himself, and somebody take the hindermost — that is all the morality in the world, at least with many. What is the reason that I should be moral? You cannot explain it except when you come to know the truth as given in the Gita: “He who sees everyone in himself, and himself in everyone, thus seeing the same God living in all, he, the sage, no more kills the Self by the self.” Know through Advaita that whomsoever you hurt, you hurt yourself; they are all you. Whether you know it or not, through all hands you work, through all feet you move, you are the king enjoying in the palace, you are the beggar leading that miserable existence in the street; you are in the ignorant as well as in the learned, you are in the man who is weak, and you are in the strong; know this and be sympathetic. And that is why we must not hurt others. That is why I do not even care whether I have to starve, because there will be millions of mouths eating at the same time, and they are all mine. Therefore I should not care what becomes of me and mine, for the whole universe is mine, I am enjoying all the bliss at the same time; and who can kill me or the universe? Herein is morality. Here, in Advaita alone, is morality explained. The others teach it, but cannot give you its reason. Then, so far about explanation.[Source]",

They say I have bad work or this good work; I am – happy or I am sorrowful; I am dull or I am intelligent and so on.’ This is ‘Ahamkara’ – a false identification of the Self with body and mind (3.27).

      "The manifold universe with all the crores of beings, in it, combining, separating, changing, evolving and so on, is in reality the one Supreme Brahman. In that one, these things exist with the apparent distinction of name and form. What about the waves on the bosom of the ocean? Does they exist separately from the ocean? No. It is the ocean itself, but by name and form they are projected out of the ocean. No one can look upon the wave as having a separate existence apart from the ocean. There may be millions of waves and yet in reality they are ocean, they may come out of the ocean and disappear in the ocean. The ocean exists, the waves come and go. So also, in Paramatma the whole universe appears to exist. It comes out of and merges in Paramatma. He is the Reality. He who understands this mystery attains Brahma Jnana and then becomes Brahman.",
      "Anupasyati:The aspirant should see the Truth clearly and firmly. He should cultivate the vision of oneness in all, till it becomes habitual to him. Thus he attains the state of Brahman. It is not enough to know it as a theory. It should be practised and realised. Then whatever he sees, he discovers it as Brahman in all places and under all circumstances.",

You said that God Himself has become everything — the universe and all living beings. Even he who meditates is God.”MASTER:“What is more, one cannot meditate unless God wills it. One can meditate when God makes it possible for one to do so. What do you say?”M:“True, sir. You feel like that because there is no ‘I’ in you. When there is no ego, one feels like that.”MASTER:“But it is good to have a trace of ego, which makes it possible for a man to feel that he is the servant of God. As long as a man thinks that it is he who is doing his duties, it is very good for him to feel that God is the Master and he God’s servant. When one is conscious of doing work, one should establish with God the relationship of servant and Master.”M. was always reflecting on the nature of the Supreme Brahman.",

The fire appears white if you throw a white substance’ into it, red if you throw a red, black it you throw a black. The three gunas — sattva, rajas, and tamas — belong to Sakti alone. Brahman Itself is beyond the three gunas. What Brahman is cannot be described. It is beyond words. That which remains after everything is eliminated by the Vedantic process of ‘Not this, not this’, and which is of the nature of Bliss, is Brahman.“Suppose the husband of a young girl has come to his father-in-law’s house and is seated in the drawing-room with other young men of his age. The girl and her friends are looking at them through the window. Her friends do not know her husband and ask her, pointing to one young man, ‘Is that your husband?’ ‘No’, she answers, smiling. They point to another young man and ask if he is her husband. Again she answers no. They repeat the question, referring to a third, and she gives the same answer. At last they point to her husband and ask, ‘Is he the one?’ She says neither yes nor no, but only smiles and keeps quiet.

The sheaths are one thing, and the pith is another. The sheaths are not the pith, and the pith is not the sheaths. But in the end one-realises that the pith cannot exist apart from the sheaths, and the sheaths cannot exist apart from the pith; they are part and parcel of one and the same banana tree. Likewise, it is God who has become the twenty-four cosmic principles; it is He who has become man.(To Dr. Sarkar) “There are three kinds of devotees: superior, mediocre, and inferior. The inferior devotee says, ‘God is out there.’ According to him God is different from His creation. The mediocre devotee says: ‘God is the Antaryami, the Inner Guide. God dwells in everyone’s heart.’ The mediocre devotee sees God in the heart. But the superior devotee sees that God alone has become everything; He alone has become the twenty-four cosmic principles. He finds that everything, above and below, is filled with God.“Read theGita, theBhagavata, and the Vedanta, and you will understand all this. Is not God in His creation?”DR.

      "Paramatma has no beginning and no end. He is not caused by anything. So He is beyond cause. All other things have a cause. They begin and they come to an end. Moreover, He is devoid of the three qualities, and consequent changes and modifications. He is Imperishable. He is actionless. He does not do anything. As He is the Infinite, how can He go or come or do this or that? He is not tainted by anything. How can the awakened man have any contact with the objects of the dream-world? So, though the body, mind and buddhi are doing many things, yet Atma stands apart steeped in His own bliss, as the actionless witness of the phenomenal world.",

He, this Lord of Lords, is so near us that we should seek for Him, find Him, and share His bliss and blessedness. The human body is the temple; Atma, the Lord is the Deity; knowing this one should fill himself with purity and light to know and see the Lord and be one with Him."

    "commentary": [
      "Ether is the subtlest of things in the material universe. So it is taken as an illustration to point out the all-pervasive, taintless, subtle nature of Atma. By simple comparisons to explain high philosophic truths, is the distinct feature of the Gita. It should not be misunderstood that Atma is ether. No. Like ether, it is subtle; that is what is meant by the comparison. Ether pervades the sky, the dust, the mire and so on, and yet it is not tainted because it is subtle. Similarly, Atma pervades the whole body, and yet it is not tainted or affected by the birth and death of the body nor by the pleasures and pains of the mind or by anything taking place through the different vehicles (upadhis). Moreover, though storm-clouds burst into a thunder, lightning and rain, and spread out in different colours yet the sky is not tainted by the cold winds and hail storm. So also, Atma is seated firm and unmovable in the body and whatever changes take place in the body and mind, it is not at all touched by them in any way whatsoever. The aspirant has to maintain with faith and courage, the attitude that he is the Self and not the body, that he has nothing to do with the innumarable troubles, sorrows, pleasures and pains of the body and the mind. This practice should be continued till it is finally and immovably fixed in the mind. Then the life of the aspirant would be fearless, sublime and blissful.",
      "Sarvatravasthito dehe:Paramatma (as declared in the previousverse) is so near our own body, that we should realise Him in our own heart by means of purity in thought, word and deed. It is clear that no distinction is made here about race, religion, sex, age, and nationality. The Supreme Truth is present in all, and will be revealed to all, if the perfect practice is undertaken. The practice is to search for the Lord within oneself by discarding the five sheaths (Pancha Kosas) with which He is covered, as pure water in a lake is covered up by moss. There is no doubt that determined seekers would find Him in the near future.",
      "Question:What is the nature of Paramatma?",
      "Answer:Though he is seated in the body, yet He is untainted by the changes and modifications in the same way as ether is not tainted by dust or mire or clouds etc."

      "The all-pervasive character of Paramatma is stated previously by the illustration of ether. Now the luminosity of Atma is declared by the illustration of the sun. Just as the sun, who is the spectator of the world, illumines the whole world by his light, so also Paramatma illumines the entire kshetram body, mind and intellect. The Sun is only one. Paramatma is One. The sun – gives light. Paramatma is light. The Sun has nothing to do with good and bad nature of men and their actions in the world. Paramatma similarly is not concerned with the functions of the body, mind and intellect. He is just the witness, like the Sun. If the sun is not there, the whole world becomes lifeless and dark. So also if Paramatma is not there, the universe would crumble to pieces and disappear into darkness and death.",

      "Answer:Like the Sun illuminating the world."

      "Evam:Thus the discrimination between kshetra and kshetrajna, between the Drik and Drisya, Purusha and prakriti, taught in this Discourse is declared to be the direct path to liberation (Moksha). Therefore, the seekers should realise the importance of the yoga, understand it clearly, and with faith in the Lord’s declaration, they should attain Brahma Jnana.",
      "Antaram:(Distinction). The intermixing of Drik and Drisya, of kshetra and kshetrajna, is the cause of bondage. The individual (Jiva) is constantly identifying himself with the kshetram (the Field). “I am the body, I am the mind, am subject to disease and death, I am suffering, I am now so and so, I belong to this caste, I am wealthy, I am poor,” – in this way man, out of avidya’ feels that he is the body, and consequently he passes through all the ills of birth and death. In truth, the real man is Kshetrajna, Drik, Atma. So it follows that all the troubles and sorrows pertain to the body and mind only and not to Atma. The thoughtful man knows the distinction clearly, and he remains unaffected by the modifications of the body and mind. The others are lost in the flood of samsara. It is the eye of knowledge that finds out the difference between the body and the dweller in the body. The whole of this Discourse deals with the sharp distinction between the two.",
      "Bhuta prakriti moksham:From time immemorial, man is bound and deluded by prakriti (Maya). Now he has awakened to that fact that he is bound, and that he should free himself from bondage. To liberate oneself from the binding veil of ‘avidya’ is Moksha. Moksha is not something to be got from the sky or the underworld. It is not an object. It is pure knowledge, the knowledge that the real man is Atma and not the body. If this knowledge is gained by discrimination between Kshetra and Kshetrajna man attains freedom and perfection. If a man feels that he is the kshetram, he is bound by prakriti; if on the other hand, he feels that he is Atma, prakriti has no power over him. How to gain this knowledge is the question for all seekers. The eye of knowledge should be opened. How is this eye of knowledge opened? How can man acquire the spiritual power of discrimination between the objective world and the subjective Drik? The Lord has made it clear that He bestows this gift on his devotees who worship Him with faith and love (tesham satata yuktanam dadami buddhi yogam). Therefore let all people worship the Lord in every way; let them purify the mind with good work for the sake of humanity; let them think and meditate on the truth, and so striving, they shall obtain the discriminatory power to reject Prakriti and find their identity with Paramatma. The Lord proclaimed the path and the goal with perfect clearness.",
      "Yanti te param:Every man whoever he is and in whatever position he may be placed, is qualified to undertake this discriminatory path and attain Moksha (Yanti-param).",
      "Question:What is Moksha?",
      "Answer:Freedom from the power of Prakriti (Avidya) is Moksha.",
      "Question:Who can attain it?",
      "Answer:Those who know the distinction between Kshetra and Kshetrajna attain Moksha.",
      "Question:How is the distinction realised?",
      "Answer:By the eye of knowledge-Viveka.",
      "Question:Therefore what is the way to attain Moksha?",
      "Answer:With the eye of knowledge, to see clearly the distinction between Kshetra and Kshetrajna, is the way to Moksha."
