      "Dhritarashtra said: Having assembled on the holy plain in Kurukshetra desirous of fighting the battle, what did my people and the Pandavas do? O Sanjaya!"
    ],
    "commentary": [
      "The Gita begins with the word Dharma. It is an auspicious word. By using it first Veda Vyasa gives an auspicious opening to his great work. The Lord is the embodiment of Dharma, Reverence for Dharma is worship of the Lord himself, by the utterence of his name. The aim of the Gita and its main teaching are determined by the very first word. It is Dharma. The lord incarnates himself from time to time to establish Dharma.",
      "Dhritarashtra:The word means one who holds a kingdom. He who appropriates to himself a kingdom which is not his, is Dhritarashtra The word has an inner meaning. The real man has nothing to do with the kingdom of the body, senses and mind. These are all objects perceived by the real man who is the seer. The body and the world are objects seen. But the ignorant man considers the body to be himself, and develops attachment and egotism in relation to the world. Therefore every ignorant man is a Dhritarashtra. To remove the blindness of ignorance by the light of the Gita is the duty of every individual.",
      "Kurukshetra:It is a holy plain which lies in Punjab, south of Ambala and north of Delhi. In the 87th Chapter of Vanaparva and the 56th Chapter of Salyaparva, the greatness of Kurukshetra is vividly described. Brahma, Indra, and Agni performed tapas in that sacred place in former yugas. Emperor Kuru, the ancestor of the Kauravas and the Pandavas, ploughed the holy plain, and so it is called Kurukshetra. Indra offered a boon to Kuru that anyone who performed tapas or left his mortal body there would ascend to higher realms of existence. Parasurama offered oblations to his ancestors there. Many great and holy men performed meritorious acts of Dharma in that place, and so it is called Dharma Kshetra.",
      "It is quite possible that Dhritarashtra might have expected some change of heart and mental conversion on the part of his sons and the Pandavas, under the influence of that holy place, and both sides might desist from the fratricidal war. Hence Dhritarashtra might have put the question in that form.",
      "My people:Dhritarashtra refers to his sons – “my people” – excluding the Pandavas, and so it is evident that the blind King is partial to his own children.",
      "Sanjaya:Samyak Jaya – Sanjaya. One whose victory is perfect is Sanjaya. It means one who has conquered his body, senses and mind. Sanjaya is the official war-reporter of the Gita. It shows that only a man of self-control and purity of heart was qualified to hear, understand, and communicate the teaching of the Gita. Moreover, Sanjaya by his personal merit, purity, and the grace of Vyasa and other sages, rendered himself fit to hear Lord Krishna’s message directly, and see the Viswarupa of the Lord. Such good fortune befell Sanjaya. Caste, race, and colour are no bar to religious merit and spiritual advancement.",
      "To the first question of Dhritarashtra, Sanjaya gives a direct answer in thelast (78th) verse of the 18th discourse."

    ],
    "commentary": [
      "Dhrishtadyumna, the son of King Drupada was the commander of the Pandava army. He arranged the army in a special formation known as Vajra Vyuha in the science of war. Duryodhana might have approached Dronacharya for the purpose of asking him to arrange his own army in a more powerful formation.",
      "Duryodhana was a king possessing overall command of the entire army. Drona was one of the commanders. How does it happen that the king, instead of asking the commander to meet him, should himself approach him personally? This doubt may be cleared by considering the following points.",
      "1. Duryodhana might have been struck with fear when he saw the enemy-army and heroes like Bhima and Arjuna. Fear, of course, is not an auspicious sign.",
      "2. Drona was a commander and should have been at the post of duty from whence he should not be disturbed at that time.",
      "3. Drona was a teacher, learned and old, and it was the duty of Duryodhana to show him respect.",
      "4. The purpose of Duryodhana was to win the favour of Drona for achieving his own selfish object of winning the war against his cousins, who were also the disciples of Drona.",
      "It should be noted that Duryodhana, like Arjuna, later saw the armies on both sides. But what a difference in attitude! Duryodhana never had any qualms of conscience, nor any feeling of pity for those who would be destroyed on both sides, nor the supreme question of what is Dharma under these circumstances, nor any reconsideration of his attitude which would naturally arise in the heart of an evolved being. Arjuna was far superior to Duryodhana as a man, and so his reaction was entirely different, and the divine message of the Gita was offered to him."

    "commentary": [
      "This and the following verses are spoken by Duryodhana. According to common usage, it should be mentioned here as Duryodhana Uvacha.’ But Veda Vyasa does not give him the privilege of naming him as the speaker because he is evil-minded.",
      "Duryodhana is deeply skilled in diplomacy. He tries to curry the favour of Drona by personally approaching him. Not only that, he tries to rouse Drona’s passions of anger and hatred by referring to Drishtadyumna as the son of King Drupada. Duryodhana knows how Drupada insulted Drona and how Drona avenged the insult by humiliating the king with the help of Arjuna, and how later, Drupada, in a vengeful spirit, obtained through holy sacrifice a son who would cause the death of Drona, and that son was no other than the present commander of the Pandava Army. Duryodhana tries to fan into flame the ancient hatred between Drona and Drupada. His purpose is evidently to rouse the combative spirit of his Master by speaking highly about the enemy-formation under the leadership of his disciple Drishtadyumna is spoken of as ‘dhimata‘ – well-versed in the art of war. So it is that the Pandavas chose him as the Commander of their army."

    "commentary": [
      "While mentioning the heroes on his side, Duryodhana first refers to Drona, and next to Bhishma, though the latter was the first supreme commander of the army. Duryodhana might have referred thus just because he was directly speaking to Drona or because it should be proper to refer to his teacher first, or because it would inspire Drona to do his best in the battle.",
      "Though Drona knew the chief heroes on either side, Duryodhana, on the pretext of reminding him, enumerates them again, and calculated the difference in strength between the two armies. He means of course that all the warriors on his side are determined to fight to the last, to lay down their lives for his sake. But by a stroke of tragic irony, it is indicative of their destruction in battle. Some commentators hold the view that it is an ill-omen for Duryodhana."

    ],
    "commentary": [
      "There is a difference of view among the commentators about the meaning of the wordsaparyaptamandparyaptam. Anandagiri, Sankarananda and others give the meaning ‘limitless’ to the wordaparyaptam, Sridhara and others give the opposite meaning ‘limited’. But it appears that the first meaning is more appropriate to the context, and is consistent with the earlier estimate given by Duryodhana. In the Udyoga Parva (54, 60, 70) and in the Bhishma Parva (51-4-6) Duryodhana, speaking to his father and Drona respectively glorifies the strength of his own army. There is every reason why he should speak well of his own army in the present situation, when they are about to fight the battle. It should also be remembered that in the Bhishma Parva speaking to Drona, Duryodhana utters exactly the same verse while estimating the superior power of his own army",
      "Well-protected by Bhima – Why should Duryodhana refer to the Pandava army as well-protected by Bhima, when Dhristadyumna is the actual commander? The following reasons may be considered.",
      "1. Duryodhana naturally thinks of Bhima as the most deadly enemy to himself and to his brothers 2. Though Dhristadyumna is the commander, Bhima was entrusted with the task of protecting the army. 3. On the first day, Bhima was posted at the foremost point of the Vajra Vyuha. So it is quite probable that Duryodhana should see Bhima first at the head of the Pandava Army."

      "Bhishma was the most powerful hero well capable of protecting himself. Why should Duryodhana caution others to keep him safe and well-protected? There is a reason for it. The son of Drupada, Sikhandi, was first a eunuch. Bhishma has pledged that he would never face a eunuch in battle. So, if the Pandavas should place Sikhandi at the foremost point of their army, Bhishma would not face it, and so his power would be partially neutralised. Taking advantage of it, the enemies might injure and kill him. Duryodhana knew the secret. So he directs all the leaders of his army to see that Sikhandi is kept out of the way, so that Bhishma would be free to fight at his best. If Bhishma was safe, he would be able to make the most powerful onslaught on the enemy, and be the bulwark of defense for the entire Kaurava army. Knowing this he directed all to protect Bhishma in all possible ways."

      "Kripa:It means pity, compassion and kindness. It is no doubt a noble quality. But it loses its divine virtue in a situation when man is called upon by Dharma to fight for a righteous cause. Arjuna was overtaken by Maya with the feelings of ‘I’ and ‘Mine’. “How can I kill my own people?” This was the cause of Arjuna’s sorrow. He lost the spirit of righteous action. Arjuna, being a Kshatriya, his pity under those circumstances, was a mental weakness, a negation of Dharma. It is this weakness which Lord Krishna removes by his spiritual teaching.",
      "Sorrowfully:Whatever material and physical powers and prowess a man may possess, if he is not free from ignorance, he sinks into despondency in any critical situation. Arjuna was a warrior of the first rank; He possessed miraculous powers and weapons. But covered by ignorance, he began to weep and wail like a helpless child. It is a disease of the mind which should be thoroughly cured. This could be done only by the knowledge of Atma which brings supreme freedom from all the undesirable modifications of the mind, from all painful feelings and passions. If a hero like Arjuna should be overpowered by grief, what of ordinary mortals? Therefore the conquest of the mind by spiritual knowledge, and through it the attainment of peace – this is the duty of every individual. Lord Krishna teaches the spiritual path to reach the goal for all human beings."

    "commentary": [
      "With the mind distressed by sorrow:Arjuna dropped the great bow Gandiva and sat down in a mood of doubt, despair and helplessness. Never before in his life did he do so on any battle-field in any situation. So there should be a powerful cause for the present problem of Arjuna. This cause is easily discernable from his own words. It is nothing but the deeply planted feeling of attachment for his relations and friends, and the awful contemplation of slaying them in the battle. He speaks repeatedly of ‘svajanam‘ (our people). His distress for the destruction of his own people touches his very heart and throws the whole man off his balance. As a result, he decides to give up every thing-kingdom, pleasures, and enjoyments, even dominion over the three worlds. Lord Krishna seizes this opportune moment when Arjuna’s mind was filled with the thought of absolute renunciation and teaches the highest Brahmavidya. Hence Arjuna’s despondency is transformed into a Yoga.",
      "Arjuna yearned to know what was Dharma, having given up all dominion, pleasures and enjoyment. Hence it is Yoga. Such deep renunciation is essential for all seekers after truth. It ultimately leads to righteousness and union with God. Dispassion for earthly enjoyments and burning passion for truth are the ‘sine quanon‘ of spiritual life. It is this passion for truth that drives the aspirant forward on the path of spiritual realisation. Arjuna experienced the two feelings in the present situation. So he is fully qualified to realise the teaching of the Lord. If any man, for any reason, is prompted by feelings of dispassion for earthly objects, and a yearning for truth, he receives the Grace of God by which he comes to know the Truth and attains peace and blessedness."
