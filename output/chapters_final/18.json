      "In different contexts in the Gita, the Lord has used the word Sannyasa and Tyaga several times (3-30;4-20;4-41;9-28;12-6;12-11;12-12;12-16;14-25). But the two terms have not been explained distinctly. Hence Arjuna’s question.",
      "In the Upanishads, the two concepts of Tyaga and Sannyasa are mentioned as means to liberation.",
      "Arjuna addresses the Lord thrice in different ways, revealing his high adoration for the Divine Teacher from whom he is learning the ultimate Truth. Such reverence for the teacher of Brahmavidya is essential for attaining spiritual illumination. The respectful questioning of Arjuna is what is known as pariprasna ‘; The proper way to approach the Guru, and place one’s doubts before him should be known by the disciple. Being pleased with such faithful devotion and reverence, the teacher showers his grace on the disciple and unravels the mystery of Divine Realisation.",
      "Question:What is Arjuna’s question?",
      "Answer:He desired to know from the Lord the distinction between Sannyasa and Tyaga in their essence.",

      "The Gita defines Sannyasa as the renunciation of desireful actions; and not, going into forests and mountain caves in search of some unknown thing. The man who renounces actions prompted by personal desire for enjoyment is practically a sannyasi, though he lives with his wife and children as a householder. Similarly, the man who abandons the fruits of actions is a Tyagi whatever may be his social position.",
      "Swamiji:… No freedom without renunciation. Highest love for God can never be achieved without renunciation. Renunciation is the word — “नान्य: पन्था विद्यते अयनाय — There’s no other way than this.” Even the Gita says, “The sages know sannyasa to be the giving up of all work that has desire for its end.” Nobody attains freedom without shaking off the coils of worldly worries. The very fact that somebody lives the worldly life proves that he is tied down to it as the bondslave of some craving or other. Why otherwise will he cling to that life at all? He is the slave either of lust or of gold, of position or of fame, of learning or of scholarship. It is only after freeing oneself from all this thraldom that one can get on along the way of freedom. Let people argue as loud as they please, I have got this conviction that unless all these bonds are given up, unless the monastic life is embraced, none is going to be saved, no attainment of brahma-jnana is possible.",
      "Disciple:Do you mean, sir, that merely taking up sannyasa will lead one to the goal?",
      "Swamiji:Whether the goal is attained or not is not the point before us now. But until you get out of this wheel of samsara, until the slavery of desire is shaken off, you can’t attain either bhakti or mukti. To the knower of Brahman, supernatural powers or prosperity are mere trivialities.[Source]",

They say that work implies the existence of the body, senses, and the mind (Upadhi) as the instruments of action. Atma is the eternal witness, and hence the upadhi is to be discarded as non-existent, and when there is no upadhi, no action can take place at all.",
      "Others argue differently. They say that there is no other way except Karma to purify the mind. Even bare existence is impossible without Karma. So, they declare that righteous work, purifying acts like sacrifice, austerity and charity should be performed. They ought not to be abandoned. Thus there is a difference of view about the performance and non-performance of Karma. Having stated the difference, the Lord proceeds to give his decisive opinion on this question.",
      "MASTER (to Manilal and the others):“It is wise to salute a person mentally. What need is there of touching his feet? Mental salutation doesn’t embarrass anybody.“The attitude that my religion alone is right and all other religions are false is not good. I see that God Himself has become all these: men, images, and salagram. I see one alone in all these; I do not see two. I see only one.“Many people think that their opinion alone is right and others’ opinions are wrong; that they alone have won and others have lost. But a person who has gone forward may be detained by some slight obstacle, and someone who has been lagging behind may then steal a march on him. In the game of golakdham one may advance a great deal, but still somehow one’s piece may fail to reach the goal.“Triumph or defeat is in the hands of God. We cannot understand His ways. You must have noticed that the green coconut remains high in the tree and is exposed to the sun, but still its milk is cool. On the other hand the paniphal (A kind of aquatic fruit.) remains in the water, but when eaten it heats the body.“Look at the body of man. The head is the root, and it is at the top.”MANILAL: “What then is our duty?”MASTER: “To remain somehow united with God. There are two ways: karmayoga and manoyoga. Householders practise yoga through karma, the performance of duty. There are four stages of life: brahmacharya, garhasthya, vanaprastha, and sannyas. Sannyasis must renounce those karmas which are performed with special ends in view; but they should perform the daily obligatory karmas, giving up all desire for results. Sannyasis are united with God by such karmas as the acceptance of the staff, the receiving of alms, going on pilgrimage, and the performance of worship and japa.“It doesn’t matter what kind of action you are engaged in. You can be united with God through any action provided that, performing it, you give up all desire for its result.“There is the other path: manoyoga. A yogi practising this discipline doesn’t show any outward sign. He is inwardly united with God. Take Jadabharata and Sukadeva, for instance. There are many other yogis of this class, but these two are well known. They shave neither hair nor beard.“All actions drop away when a man reaches the stage of the paramahamsa. He always remembers the ideal and meditates on it. He is always united with God in his mind. If he ever performs an action it is to teach men.“A man may be united with God either through action or through inwardness of thought, but he can know everything through bhakti. Through bhakti one spontaneously experiences kumbhaka. The nerve currents and breathing calm down when the mind is concentrated. Again, the mind is concentrated when the nerve currents and breathing calm down. Then the buddhi, the discriminating power, becomes steady. The man who achieves this state is not himself aware of it.

Their position is directly opposed to the Lord’s will. Righteous work of every kind is encouraged very frequently in the Gita. In this verse, the Lord warns not to abandon good acts like sacrifice, austerity and charity. He commands that they should be performed.

When the daughter-in-law is with child, her mother-in-law gives her less work to do. As time goes by she is given less and less work. When the time of delivery nears, she is not allowed to do any work at all, lest it should hurt the child or cause difficulty at the time of birth.“By these philanthropic activities you are really doing good to yourself.

He is lazy and the dullness of the body overpowers him, preventing him from doing the practices. It is true that action which is ultimately beneficial is at first difficult to follow. So, the man of weak will-power neglects it from sheer fear of bodily pain. He renounces them as useless or beyond his power to practice. To get up at the auspicious time of Brahmamuhurta (4 A.M.), taking a good bath in cold water in the river or from a well, practising the vow of celibacy, and such other methods may appear difficult in the beginning, but in the long run, they yield the highest reward of joy and happiness, health and strength. The Rajasic Tyagi is foregoing a great good for a slight cause. Such is the power of the flesh over the spirit. We find that every great man in any field has mastered the body and made it a simple instrument for useful work.

      "From this verse, one should clearly understand that renunciation of attachment and desire for fruit, is Sattvic renunciation, and not certainly the abandoning of obligatory duties. The word ‘karyam’ is used to show that prescribed sastraic duties ought to be performed. The ignorant man neglects them from delusion, and the Rajasic man abandons them from fear of bodily pain. The Sattvic man understands the real value of the duties prescribed in the Sastras, and performs them in spite of bodily discomfort, without a sense of doership, without attachment for their rewards. This type of renunciation is true Tyaga, and by such Tyaga, man attains purity and liberation.",

      "The embodied being has to perform action if only for the maintenance of the body. It is impossible for anyone to renounce action altogether. Therefore, working without concern for any reward flowing from it, is the best method of life. He is not bound by action. He alone is called the real Tyagi.We understand clearly that Tyaga definitely means the renunciation of the fruits of action and not the actions.There should not be any sense of doership; there should not be any secret longing to enjoy the fruits of work. No one can be a tyagi by simply giving up work, nor can he obtain the merit of renunciation. Performing all works and yet being unconcerned with fruits is the characteristic feature of the true Tyagi. Abandoning external objects is not Tyaga. The abandoning of the mental attitude, the internal thought of enjoyment, is the ‘sine quo non’ of true Tyaga. Therefore, the Lord’s command is to carry out all prescribed duties in a selfless detached spirit.",

Further, if a man has become habituated to such ceremonies, he feels restless if he does not observe them.“One day I saw a sannyasi under the banyan-tree. He had put the salagram on the same carpet with his guru’s sandals. He was worshipping them. I said to him, ‘If you have attained Knowledge to that extent,8then why such formal worship at all?’ He replied: ‘What difference does it make? Since I do everything else, why not this too?

      "The Lord further elaborates on the theme of non-attachment in action. This verse is an answer to those who argue that action should be abandoned because it causes future birth.To whom does Karma cause bondage? Not for all; Karma binds only those who have a sense of doership (Kartrtvabhavana) who have a desire for enjoying the fruits of work.But for those who have abandoned both these, Karma has no power to bind them in any way.",
      "Threefold is the fruits of action. Evil actions cause low births like beasts and reptiles etc. Good actions cause higher births in the Devaloka. And action mixed with evil and good produce human birth. Such is the effect of action according to its nature. But these effects are felt only by those who are attached to work. They reap the good and evil effects of their actions in future birth after death.",
      "But these effects are neutralised by the wise man who has no desire for enjoyment either here or hereafter, who has, therefore, no attachment for the fruits of actions, and who is freed from the delusion of egotism and doership. The word ‘kvachit’ implies that at no time is the Tyagi affected by the work which he has performed. He attains Moksha by the very power of his renunciation. There is no question of a future birth for him. The whole machinery of birth and death stops for him, or he has got out of the terrible wheel of samsara. How wonderful is the reward of Nishkamakarma! How the Lord loves this holy path to self-realisation!"

The word ‘kritante’ is used in the sense that when the knowledge of the Self arises, all actions terminate. In the Vedanta Sastra, (in the Upanishads), Atma is declared to be distinct from and transcending Prakriti, and all actions are performed by Prakriti only, and Atma remains as the eternal witness. The Vedanta is the termination of all Karma. “Sarvam Karmakhilam Partha Jnane Parisamapyate” With the knowledge of the Self all actions come to end, all Karma culminates in jnana. When the Atmic state is realised, the mind, senses and the body cease to exist, and so there cannot be any action whatsoever. That state is beyond Karma. Action can take place only at the lower planes of body and mind. When they are transcended by Atma-jnana, action automatically comes to an end. That is the reason why the word ‘Kritanta’ is used for the Vedanta Sastra, which teaches Atmajnana.",

Learning and scholarship mastery of all worldly sciences and arts do not confer Atmajnana, and so they remain in the realm of ‘Avidya’ and cannot perceive the truth of Atma.

The Lord wants to emphasise the absolutely pure and perfect nature of Atma, which is independent of every phenomenal change.",
      "Good and evil arise from action done with a feeling of personal doership.Descending from the Atmic state, man identifies himself with the mind and body, and hence he gets bound by his own actions.Freed from this delusion, man knows that he is the Atma, the eternal actionless Self. There is no ‘punya’ or ‘papa’ for him. He has gone beyond good and evil. Any amount of good does not bind him, and so also no amount of evil can come to him. For that man the little ‘I’ is dead and gone, and so there is neither the doer nor the enjoyer.",
      "Arjuna, being a Kshatriya, has the duty prescribed by the Sastras to protect the righteous and destroy the wicked. The Kauravas should be slain for their unrighteousness. The Lord says to the warrior-disciple, “O Arjuna! fight the battle and slay the Kauravas, but do so knowing fully that you are not the personal agent of action, that you are in truth the Eternal Self. Then you shall remain free”. Thus here is the Lord’s reply to Arjuna’s original doubt – “How can I kill my own people ?”",
      "The freedom of Atma from all good and evil is the Truth. Those who have reached that state have gone beyond both. And yet, let it be firmly known that when the Atmajnani acts using the lower instruments, his actions are full of compassion for mankind. His hands do only good work. His mind thinks only good thoughts. His lips speak only good words, benedictions for all. He acts, if he so desires, for the welfare of all beings. Here is the real test of Atmajnana. Evil cannot dare come anywhere near him. He is like the lion of whom the lower beasts are afraid and come not near. Let the aspirants bear this clearly in mind and test their knowledge by the purity of their thoughts and actions. Let them not fall into the error of claiming Atmic freedom and plunging into the evils of sensual enjoyments.",
      "The Master was gradually regaining consciousness of the outer world. Looking at the devotees he said: “Years ago I used to be amazed to see people keeping kai fish alive in a pot of water. I would say: ‘How cruel these people are! They will finally kill the fish.’ But later, as changes came over my mind, I realised that bodies are like pillow-cases. It doesn’t matter whether they remain or drop off.”BHAVANATH:“Then may one injure a man without incurring sin? Kill him?”MASTER:“Yes, it is permissible if one has achieved that state of mind, But not everyone has it. It is the state of Brahmajnana.“By coming down a step or two from samadhi I enjoy bhakti and bhakta. “There exist in God both vidya and avidya. Vidyamaya leads one to God, and avidyamaya away from Him. Knowledge, devotion, compassion; and renunciation belong to the realm of vidya. With the help of these a man comes near God. One step more and he attains God, Knowledge of Brahman. In that state he clearly feels and sees that it is God who has become everything. He has nothing to give up and nothing to accept. It is impossible tor him to be angry with anyone. …..",
      "(To Ram) “You are a physician. You know that medicine works only when it mixes with the patient’s blood and becomes one with it. Likewise, in the state of Brahmajnana one sees God both within and without. One sees that it is God Himself who has become the body, mind, life, and soul.”M. (to himself): “Assimilation!”MASTER:“A man attains Brahmajnana as soon as his mind is annihilated. With the annihilation of the mind dies the ego, which says ‘I’, ‘I’. One also attains the Knowledge of Brahman by following the path of devotion. One also attains It by following the path of knowledge, that is to say, discrimination. The jnanis discriminate, saying, ‘Neti, neti’, that is, ‘All this is illusory, like a dream.’ They analyse the world through the process of ‘Not this, not this’; it is maya. When the world vanishes, only the jivas, that is to say, so many egos, remain.“Each ego may be likened to a pot. Suppose there are ten pots filled with water, and the sun is reflected in them. How many suns do you see?”A DEVOTEE:“Ten reflections. Besides, there certainly exists the real sun.”MASTER:“Suppose you break one pot. How many suns do you see now?”DEVOTEE:“Nine reflected suns. But there certainly exists the real Sun.”MASTER:“All right. Suppose you break nine pots. How many suns do you see now?”DEVOTEE:“One reflected sun. But there certainly exists the real sun.”MASTER (to Girish):“What remains when the last pot is broken?”GIRISH:“That real sun, sir.”MASTER:“No. What remains cannot be described. Whatisremains. How will you know there is a real sun unless there is a reflected sun? ‘I- consciousness’ is destroyed in samadhi. A man climbing down from samadhi to the lower plane cannot describe what he has seen there.” (Source:Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna)",

      "To the physical eye and the deluded mind, the beings of the world both moving and non-moving appear distinct and separate from one another. They are divided into separate categories. But to man in whom the knowledge is opened, the one inseparable and indivisible Brahman alone appears as the one Reality pervading all. That knowledge by which this oneness is discovered, known and seen is called Sattvic Jnana.",
      "Sarvabhuteshu:The Lord (Atma) is present in all beings of the universe. So, even the lowest of beings have the Lord as their background and foundation. Knowing it every one can reach the Supreme. Though the wave is small and weak, yet the foundation for it is the mighty ocean. Merging in it, the little wave realises its mighty reality. So also, the little man, who is thinking of himself as low, weak, wretched and miserable, can realise his immeasurable power and knowledge by merging in Atma, the one reality behind everything in the universe. Know that you are Atma, and you are freed from all limitations.",
      "The wise man sees the ocean behind the millions of waves big and small. He sees the clay in the millions of earthen pots of different shapes and sizes. He sees the string behind the hundreds of colourful flowers in the garland. This is the perception of the Reality behind the appearances. By this knowledge, man sees one indivisible ocean of Sachidananda throughout the universe. In the Sun, in the Moon, in the stars, in the oceans and mountains and rivers and trees, in men and women, in all the animals, birds and all beings moving and immoving, he sees the one Self, Atma, the Lord. In the diversity, he sees the unity; in the perishing, he sees the indestructible; in the insentient matter, he sees the one consciousness; in the changing, he sees the changeless. This is Sattvic Jnana. From this, we understand that ignorance is the cause of the perception of manifoldness. Knowledge sees the One, ignorance the many.",
      "Three attributes are mentioned referring to Atma. 1. One, 2. Indestructible 3. Indivisible. The difference between Atma and the objective universe is given below.",
      "People speak of different kinds of knowledge in the world, such as knowledge of physics or mathematics, or the arts like painting and architecture, etc., of the administrative and political systems, and so on. This knowledge does not take one beyond the objective world. The unity is not perceived or apprehended by this knowledge. What science can teach people to know the one indivisible, Indestructible Atma? What science can take them beyond the reach of death and destruction? What science can help them to see the Eternal and Immortal in this constantly changing universe? No material science can open this eye of knowledge. It is Brahma Vidya alone that will enable men to see the world as it really is. It is Brahmajnana alone that enables men to know what they really are, and which will shatter the blinding veil of ignorance and delusion. Of what use is all the knowledge of the world without knowing the basis, the foundation of all beings? So, let all aspire for that knowledge which alone will unravel the inscrutable mystery of life and death, and which will take beyond the horrible shadows of destruction whereunder all people are moving with fear and sorrow. Let us not be content with a little bit of intellectual culture and imagine it to be the be-all and end-all of life. All other kinds of knowledge cannot give a person the Absolute Truth. As a result, man lives and dies in samsara, and goes through the endless suffering of birth and death again and again.",
      "The Upanishads declare the same truth.",
      "Therefore, whatever being we see, we should try to go beyond the external name and form, and look at the reality, Atma, invariably present in all beings. To see only the object, its shape, form, and size, is the lowest, to see its qualities is a better-developed vision, and to see the Atma, the basis and the foundation of all objects, is the highest vision. By the last, man realises the Self in himself and in all beings. This Sattvic Jnana is the highest state and the ultimate goal of all spiritual endeavour.",
      "It is true that the Upanishads have this one theme before them:कस्मिन्नु भगवो विज्ञाते सर्वमिदं विज्ञातं भवति।— “What is that knowing which we know everything else?” In modern language, the theme of the Upanishads is to find an ultimate unity of things. Knowledge is nothing but finding unity in the midst of diversity. Every science is based upon this; all human knowledge is based upon the finding of unity in the midst of diversity; and if it is the task of small fragments of human knowledge, which we call our sciences, to find unity in the midst of a few different phenomena, the task becomes stupendous when the theme before us is to find unity in the midst of this marvellously diversified universe, where prevail unnumbered differences in name and form, in matter and spirit — each thought differing from every other thought, each form differing from every other form. Yet, to harmonise these many planes and unending Lokas, in the midst of this infinite variety to find unity, is the theme of the Upanishads. On the other hand, the old idea of Arundhati Nyâya applies. To show a man the fine star Arundhati, one takes the big and brilliant nearest to it, upon which he is asked to fix his eyes first, and then it becomes quite easy to direct his sight to Arundhati. This is the task before us, and to prove my idea I have simply to show you the Upanishads, and you will see it. Nearly every chapter begins with dualistic teaching, Upâsanâ. God is first taught as some one who is the Creator of this universe, its Preserver, and unto whom everything goes at last. He is one to be worshipped, the Ruler, the Guide of nature, external and internal, yet appearing as if He were outside of nature and external. One step further, and we find the same teacher teaching that this God is not outside of nature, but immanent in nature. And at last both ideas are discarded, and whatever is real is He; there is no difference. तत्त्वमसि श्वेतकेतो — “Shvetaketu, That thou art.” That Immanent One is at last declared to be the same that is in the human soul. Here is no Compromise; here is no fear of others’ opinions. Truth, bold truth, has been taught in bold language, and we need not fear to preach the truth in the same bold language today, and, by the grace of God, I hope at least to be one who dares to be that bold preacher.[Source]",

This knowledge is the cause of all friction and conflict everywhere. When mankind is separated by religion, race, nationality, and political doctrines, the result is conflict as we see it everywhere in the world. This knowledge is not knowledge, because it does not enable one to see the underlying unity of all beings. The Advaitic vision of the universal existence of Atma is the true vision, and it is this vision only that can put an end to all frictions and conflicts in the world.

No one should consider his personal opinion as the measure of Truth. Every seeker should know what is ordained in the Sastras, examine it by personal experience, and then act rightly in all matters. Half-digested notions, fanciful theories, personal likes and dislikes, are nowadays taken as basic truths by individual members of society. Independent judgment has come down to the level of personal feelings of men who are subject to a hundred vile passions and prejudices. So, without deluding oneself by clinging to his own views, notions, and opinions, men should act according to the Sastras, as the Sastras embody the combined wisdom of sages who have gone beyond ‘raga’ and dvesha’, and whose only aim is to work for the welfare of humanity.",

There should not be the feeling “I am doing this or that, this is my work”. This is the secret of work. Such work does not blind. The message of the Gita is this secret of work.The call to action and the way how to perform the action, are the chief instructions of the Gita.",

He acts because the Sastras have sanctioned the action, and is not conscious of any personal feeling or attachment to its end. He is, therefore, free and joyous. Desire for reward is bondage; egoism is bondage. The seekers should learn to avoid these two great evils which bind the self to the wheel of Karma.",
      "Question:What is the nature of Rajasic Karma?",
      "Answer: 1. It is done with a desire for fruit; 2. It is performed with the egotistic feeling “I am the doer”; 3. It causes much exertion."

    ],
    "commentary": [
      "As man is constantly acting in everyday life, it is necessary for him to know what the best qualities of an agent should be. Here, four conditions are prescribed for the Sattvic agent.",
      "1. He should be free from longing for the fruits of his work. This detachment enables the agent to maintain his freedom in the midst of the work he is doing. In fact, it is this spirit of freedom which is to be safeguarded at every turn in this course of earthly life. Freedom is the very essence of spiritual realisation.",
      "2. The absence of the egotistic feeling ‘I am the doer; I am doing this or that is the second quality of the Sattvic agent. It is a clear perception that all action is performed only by the Gunas and the instruments of action. When a man attains this clearness of understanding, he is finally aware that he is not the real actor or agent. He has no egotistic feeling. He remains a witness of all that he is doing with his body, senses and mind.",
      "3. The third attribute of the Sattvic agent is firmness and enthusiasm. Timidity and despondence have no place in the spiritual field. Such a man cannot make any progress towards the goal. In fact it was despondence that overtook Arjuna on the battlefield as described in the opening chapter of the Gita. The effects of such low spirits are vividly described there.The message of the Gita is to lift up the fallen soul by asserting the inherent divinity of human beings.“I am the ever pure (suddha), intelligent (buddha) free (mukta) Atma”-this thought kept up frequently gives infinite strength and courage to man. In truth, man is not the perishable body or the fickle mind, or the deluded intellect. He is Atma, the indivisible ocean of Sat Chit Ananda. What can frighten and terrify him? So thinking and realising, man moves forward with courage and resolution.",
      "4. The fourth attribute is equanimity in the midst of success and failure. If failure comes, he is not deterred but strives again and again till success comes to him. The seeker comes across severe hurdles in the course of his journey to the ultimate, but undaunted by obstacles which may appear superhuman, he moves forward, for he knows that the spirit shall finally triumph over matter. Thus the Sattvic agent is firm as a rock in the midst of the trials and shocks of life. He is full of hope and courage. He knows the ephemeral nature of the world and the reality of the Self, transcending all that is phenomenal in this world and in all the worlds altogether.",
      "“There are innumerable pathways leading to the Ocean of Immortality. The essential thing is to reach the Ocean. It doesn’t matter which path you follow. Imagine that there is a reservoir containing the Elixir of Immortality. You will be immortal if a few drops of the Elixir somehow get into your mouth. You may get into the reservoir either by jumping into it, or by being pushed into it from behind, or by slowly walking down the steps. The effect is one and the same. You will become immortal by tasting a drop of that Elixir.",
      "“Innumerable are the ways that lead to God. There are the paths of jnana, of karma, and of bhakti. If you are sincere, you will attain God in the end, whichever path you follow. Roughly speaking, there are three kinds of yoga: jnanayoga, karmayoga, and bhaktiyoga.“What is jnanayoga? The jnani seeks to realise Brahman. He discriminates, saying, ‘Not this, not this’. He discriminates, saying, ‘Brahman is real and the universe illusory.’ He discriminates between the Real and the unreal. As he comes to the end of discrimination, he goes into samadhi and attains the Knowledge of Brahman.“What is karmayoga? Its aim is to fix one’s mind on God by means of work. That is what you are teaching. It consists of breath-control, (Breathing exercises as prescribed in rajayoga.) concentration, meditation, and so on, done in a spirit of detachment. If a house- holder performs his duties in the world in a spirit of detachment, surrendering the results to God and with devotion to God in his heart, he too may be said to practise karmayoga. Further, if a person performs worship, japa, and other forms of devotion, surrendering the results to God, he may be said to practise karmayoga. Attainment of God alone is the aim of karmayoga.“What is bhaktiyoga? It is to keep the mind on God by chanting His name and glories. For the Kaliyuga the path of devotion is easiest. This is indeed the path for this age.",
      "“The path of karma is very difficult. First of all, as I have just said, where will one find the time for it nowadays? Where is the time for a man to perform his duties as enjoined in the scriptures? Man’s life is short in this age. Further,it is extremely difficult to perform one’s duties in a spirit of detachment, without craving the result. One cannot work in such a spirit without first having realised God. Attachment to the result somehow enters the mind, though you may not be aware of it.“To follow jnanayoga in this age is also very difficult. First, a man’s life depends entirely on food. Second, he has a short span of life. Third, he can by no means get rid of body-consciousness; and the Knowledge of Brahman is impossible without the destruction of body-consciousness. The jnani says: ‘I am Brahman; I am not the body. I am beyond hunger and thirst, disease and grief, birth and death, pleasure and pain.’ How can you be a jnani if you are conscious of disease, grief, pain, pleasure, and the like? A thorn enters your flesh, blood flows from the wound, and you suffer very badly from the pain; but nevertheless if you are a jnani you must be able to say: ‘Why, there is no thorn in my flesh at all. Nothing is the matter with me.’“Therefore bhaktiyoga is prescribed for this age. By following this path one comes to God more easily than by following the others. One can undoubtedly reach God by following the paths of jnana and karma, but they are very difficult paths.",
      "“Bhaktiyoga is the religion for this age. But that does not mean that the lover of God will reach one goal and the philosopher and worker another. It means that if a person seeks the Knowledge of Brahman he can attain It by following the path of bhakti, too. God, who loves His devotee, can give him the Knowledge of Brahman if He so desires.“But the bhakta wants to realise the Personal God endowed with form and talk to Him. He seldom seeks the Knowledge of Brahman. But God, who does everything at His pleasure, can make His devotee the heir to His infinite glories if it pleases Him. He gives His devotee both the Love of God and the Knowledge of Brahman. If one is able somehow to reach Calcutta, one can see the Maidan and the museum and other places too. The thing is how to reach Calcutta.“By realizing the Divine Mother of the Universe, you will get Knowledge (BG 10.11) as well as Devotion. You will get both. In bhava samadhi you will see the form of God, and in nirvikalpa samadhi you will realise Brahman, the Absolute Existence-Knowledge-Bliss. In nirvikalpa samadhi ego, name, and form do not exist.",
      "“A lover of God prays to the Divine Mother: ‘O Mother, I am very much afraid of selfish actions. Such actions have desires behind them, and if I perform them I shall have to reap their fruit. But it is very difficult to work in a detached spirit. I shall certainly forget Thee, O Mother, if I involve myself in selfish actions. Therefore I have no use for them. “May my actions, O Divine Mother, be fewer every day till I attain Thee. May I perform, without attachment to the results, only what action is absolutely necessary for me. May I have great love for Thee as I go on with my few duties. May I not entangle myself in new work so long as I do not realise Thee. But I shall perform it if I receive Thy command. Otherwise not.'” (Source:Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna)",

    "commentary": [
      "Firm courage is exhibited by men in various directions in the world. Some fight harmless, some roam about freely in dark and dangerous forests, some climb mountain peaks, some reach the moon in rockets, and so on. We are able to see and understand this style of courage and firmness. But here, the firm holding of the internal forces is explained. The mind, the vital forces, the external and internal instruments of the body, should be held, and controlled, by unswerving Yogic concentration. This is Sattvic Dhriti’. The yogi is determined to conquer the whole of the inner universe and keep it under his control. He draws the mind back from the innumerable temptations of the sense-enjoyment; he frees himself from the tremendous delusion of the objective universe. This is Sattvic courage and firmness. Besides worldly courage which helps man to overcome external difficulties and dangers, one should cultivate firmness of Yoga in the conquest of the internal forces.",
      "This courage should be unswerving, firm, and immovable. Therefore it is described as ‘avyabhicharinya‘. We see that the courage of renunciation is strong sometimes and weak at other times. It stays for some period and when its hold is loosened, the seeker once again reverts to the old enslaved way of life. Such sporadic fits of courage or firmness are not of much use in the spiritual path. So, it is declared by the Lord that the Sattvic Dhriti’ is unswerving, firm, immovable under all circumstances.",
      "Question:What is the nature of‘Sattvic Dhriti’?",
      "Answer:That courage by which man conquers all the internal forces and establishes himself firmly in the Self, is called Sattvic."

      "Firmness is a virtue indeed. But it can be misused and produce evil effects. The Tamasic man is overcome by sleep, fear, grief, and despair. Pride and conceit never leave him. Thus his firmness wastes itself in self-destructive ways. Therefore, the true seeker should strive to attain spiritual virtues by proper orientation of his mental attitude. He should strive to cultivate kindness, compassion, devotion, and knowledge, and acquire God’s grace. Sage Valmiki at first misused his faculties in evil ways. But later on, by his companionship with perfected men, he was able to know what was Dharma, and what God-realisation was, and from that onwards, he spent his life singing the Glories of Rama and attained the highest state.",

It is a practical science and should be understood by personal experience. Then alone man realises esteemed peace and bliss. Many people ask the question-“How can we realise Atma, transcend pain and suffering, and attain bliss”? The Lord answers the question here. “Practice, and you shall attain that state,” says the Lord. Nothing can be achieved by mere talk and mere study of books. You can get butter only by churning the curd. You can get sweet juice only by crushing the sugar cane. You can get oil only by crushing the seeds. Therefore, by practice alone man can come to the end of pain and attain bliss.",
      "Dukhantam cha nigacchati:This is the fundamental question for all living beings. Where is true joy and how is it to be attained? From the lowest germs and worms up to the creator Brahma, this question is asked, and the answer to this question is escaping mankind in spite of repeated efforts to find it. Where is the place to search for true joy? Is it anywhere in the world? Can these objects of the material universe give it? Can anybody purchase true joy with money or lands or kingdoms? Man is searching for it with all his skill and intelligence. But he is not able to find it anywhere in the material objective world. True joy is only in Atma, in the Divine. Man finds true joy when the mind attains the state of true Sattva. The moment when the mind reaches the Sattvic state, all sorrow comes to an end. So, the Lord’s declaration should be constantly kept in mind, and man should know clearly that all Rajasic and Tamasic tendencies and actions lead to pain and sorrow. Thus knowing, he should strive his best to keep the mind in the Sattvic state and experience the bliss of Atma. By the constant practice of Divine virtues, by eliminating the ego, by constant contemplation of the real Self, man attains true joy which is the very essence of Atma.",

    "commentary": [
      "In the spiritual life, the practice of self-restraint, mind-control, and the destruction of impure tendencies produce a slight feeling of unrest, physical and mental pain. But the pain is turned into pure joy in the end. As the seeker acquires facility in sadhana, he begins to experience Sattvic joy. This is like nectar. The aspirant should never forget that the pain which he is enduring will yield the richest and the most plentiful joy in the end. So he should remain strong and determined and should not waver in continuing his sadhana. The pain is like poison, and certainly not poison (visham iva). The struggle with the impure tendencies accumulated in innumerable past births would be naturally severe and painful, but the pain is only apparent and not real. This should be clearly kept in mind so that the seeker is not depressed by the painful experience of self-discipline in the early stages of the sadhana.The struggle is inevitable. It is a part of spiritual life and no one can hope to attain the highest without going through the conflict between the lower and higher natures. But one can rest assured that the higher nature is the real power behind everything and so it shall come out victorious at the end, however deep-rooted the impure vasanas might be in the mind of the Sadhaka.The apparent pain of self-denial is only the prelude to the attainment of Brahmananda.",
      "For certain diseases, very bitter medicines are administered. Though the medicine is bitter to the taste, it gives good health. One has to take the medicine for his own good. When a shapeless stone is transformed into a beautiful image of God, it receives the hard knocks of the sculptor’s hammer. When a lump of gold is transformed into a beautiful ornament, it receives the sharp strokes of the jeweler’s hammer. So also to attain Brahmananda man has to practice self-denial and sacrifice. The little sense pleasures which man gives up give him some pain in the beginning. They have been with him as relation in home during a long series of births. When they are given up, some slight pain is caused as when a dear relation passes away. The Sadhaka should not be disheartened. A little persistence and pursuance will bring about the necessary change and when the difficulty passes away the joy of the spirit begins to manifest slowly.",
      "Hard work and study in student-life results in prosperity and joy in later life. We see that in the lives of many people. So also in spiritual life, the aspirant has to endure some initial discomfort and pain, and move forward with firm determination. He should not be deterred by the obstacles of the early passing phase. That is why the Lord here declares that ‘sattvic happiness’ which apparently appears painful contains the seeds of divine bliss. To throw away the inherent divine bliss by fear of external discomforts would be very foolish. So, the seekers should constantly remind themselves of the pure bliss that awaits them when the initial obstacles are overcome by firm resistance, and indomitable will. One should be a hero on the spiritual path. The Upanishads declare that only a hero (Dhirah) can obtain the vision of Paramatma. The lives of Lord Buddha, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, and others reveal this truth. This Atmic bliss is not like the drink of the Gods which enables them to live longer than the mortals. It is pure nectar, conferring everlasting bliss unaffected by anything whatsoever. It takes mankind beyond the whirlpool of birth and death and establishes the original state of freedom and perfection.",
      "Atmabuddhi prasadajam:This Sattvic joy is born of the purity of the intellect, freed from all sensual contacts, pleasures, and delusions. So, the seeker should keep the ‘buddhi’ clean and clear, and thus he perceives and experiences the bliss of Atma. Freedom from all sorrow and suffering is not to be found everywhere in the upper or the underworlds. It is directly present in the purified ‘Buddhi’. Maharshi Vasishta declares the same truth inYogavasishta.",
      "Question:What is the nature of Sattvic joy?",
      "Answer:It appears bitter like poison in the beginning but turns out to be sweet and blissful like nectar in the end.",
      "Question:How can man experiences this bliss?",
      "Answer:It flows from the purified intellect (‘buddhi’). So, man has to give up the hankering for sense-pleasures and purify his mind.",
      "Question:What then is the duty of man?",
      "Answer:He should not be deterred by the initial difficulties on the spiritual path, but continue his Sadhana with firm faith in God. He should wash the mind thoroughly of all impure tendencies which bind him to the material world."

      "Sense pleasures are momentary. They are produced by the contact of sense organs with material objects. Moreover, the sense-pleasures, though they appear sweet and attractive on the surface, lead to pain, sorrow, and suffering in the end. So, Rajasic pleasure is like a cup of poison with a thin film of milk over it. It is dangerous and fatal to seek it. Man is deluded by the superficial glitter and glamour of sense attractions and rushes to his own destruction by running after them with foolish zeal and enthusiasm. Knowing it as such, who will pursue them? Who will love them? Who will hanker after them? The wise man takes the hint from the Lord’s command and abandons all unworthy ends and purpose in life.",
      "All that glitters is not gold. The glitter of sense-pleasures is easily understood even by an uncritical mind in the daily course of human life. What is necessary is to pause for a moment and enquire into the nature of such pleasure and its consequence. Such enquiry repeatedly carried out will enable the seeker to know the true nature of the sense pleasures, and when it is known the mind ceases to run after them. Of course, by the force of past samskaras, man runs after such pleasures, and so a persistent and resolute effort is to be made to clear up the rubbish and make the mind clean and pure. Repeated efforts alone can turn the mind back from pursuing external objects. The path may be difficult, but not impossible. The Lord will sustain the effort of man and give him the necessary strength. Such is the Lord’s assurance to the sincere seeker. No defeat, no despair, no pessimism, no lethargy can overtake the man of steady and unswerving faith.",

So, the accident of birth is not the real criterion to fix the special gradation of the caste system. It shows that caste is no bar for anyone who aspires for Self-realisation. Though the birth is apparently in the lower castes, man can ascend to great spiritual heights by the purity of his character and conducts.

By performing one’s own duties without attachment to the fruits, man releases himself from the binding effects of Karma which is the cause of Samsara. Since the majority of men are compelled by their very nature to engage themselves in their respective duties, the best way for such is to continue their work in a spirit of self-surrender to the Lord. By such detached action, the mind is purified and the Self is realised. Thus Karma is the way to Atmajnana through the purification of the mind.",

Therefore the worship of Paramatma is the highest duty of man in whom Paramatma is manifesting in the highest degree.",

He is not seen with the external eye, but to the eye of knowledge, He is visible. He is ‘Sarvasakshi’, the Seer of everything because He is present in the innermost core of every being. So realising, man should be pure in thought and deed and should be devoted to Him who is the origin and source of his very being.",
      "Svakarmana tam abhyarcha:The performance of one’s own duty is itself the worship of the Lord. This is the excellence of Kamayoga. The tiller in the field, the worker in the factory, the judge in the court, the minister in the cabinet, the trader, the cobbler, in fact, every man who is engaged in some form of work or other, can transform and sublimate that work into the worship of the Lord by offering it to Him-the action and its fruits altogether. Thus every step that he takes, every breath that he breathes, every action that he does becomes worship of the Lord. Such worship automatically purifies the mind, because the mind is agitated only when man becomes attached to his work for selfish ends and by selfish motives. He who can maintain the attitude of detachment and surrender remains restful and lives in peace. Such peace leads to the vision of Paramatma. Of all the methods mentioned to purify the mind, this is the best and most easy to practice. As man is engaged in some form of work, the ideal is to perform it as worship of the Lord, free from fear and anxiety, free from binding egotism and binding selfishness.",
      "Thus Karma becomes the means to Moksha. Karma binds only when the performer desires to obtain this or that fruit either in this world or in other worlds. Man knows in his heart of hearts that he is attached to work by contemplating the pleasure of enjoying the rewards.

      "The Lord declares that one should not give up his prescribed duty though it appears difficult to perform it fully and completely. The duties of another man appear easy and attractive, but the true seeker should stick to his own method and way of life. This is certainly better than abandoning one’s own duty and taking up another’s and doing it even meritoriously. We have to refer this statement to Arjuna’s original plea to abandon fighting and to live the life of a mendicant. Arjuna is a Kshatriya and his duty born of his own nature is to fight. He should not give up this duty. He should perform it in the true spirit of a Karma-Yogi. By doing so, he does not incur sin. The principle holds good to all men engaged in various forms of work each according to his nature.",
      "The verse may be interpreted in another way. ‘Svadharma’ may be taken to mean Atma dharma’. To think of Atma and meditate on that may appear difficult, and living the life of the senses in the objective world may be easy. But the real seeker should continue the ‘Atma-dharma’ in spite of difficulties and failures. In fact, Atma-dharma’ is the real state of man, and life in the senses and the objective world is an alien imposition,- ‘paradharma‘. Though ‘paradharma‘ appears easy and pleasing for the time being, it leads to bondage and sorrow in the end. ‘Atma-dharma’ on the other hand, though appearing to be difficult and troublesome in the beginning, leads to bliss and liberation in the end. So ‘Atma-dharma’ is infinitely better than ‘Paradharma‘. in the end.",
      "One should not condemn any method practised by a person who genuinely believes in his heart of hearts that it will enable him to realize God. The spiritual attitude of no one should be interfered with. For, if one rightly grasps any attitude, through it alone one can realize the divine Lord, who is the embodiment of all attitudes. Stick to your own attitude and continue calling on Him. But never condemn anybody’s attitude nor try to make another’s attitude your own.— Sri Ramakrishna (Source: Sri Ramakrishna The Great Master)",

      "As the action is performed by the senses and the physical organs, it is within the region of the objective world, conditioned by the three Gunas. Therefore all action is attended with some form of evil or other. All action is ‘Anatma’; it is objective, and it is corrupted by Gunas, so all action partakes of evil. Fire is enveloped by smoke. There can be no fire without the covering evil of smoke. In spite of it, one should not abandon the duty to which he is born, because if it is performed with detachment and in a spirit of surrender to the Lord, it purifies the mind and leads to liberation.",
      "The inevitable evils attendant in all actions is purified by various rites and rituals. Enquiry into the nature of Brahman, mediation, and other sanctified methods of spiritual practice will wash off the impurities clinging to the mind. Therefore one should continue to act in the condition in which he is placed, without attachment to fruits thereof and in a spirit of self-surrender. That man attains the highest state.",
      "We find that Krishna’s message has also a place for us. Without that message, we cannot move at all. We cannot conscientiously and with peace, joy, and happiness, take up any duty of our lives without listening to the message of Krishna: “Be not afraid even if there is evil in your work, for there is no work which has no evil.” “Leave it unto the Lord, and do not look for the results.”[Source]",
      "The result of every work is mixed with good and evil. There is no good work that has not a touch of evil in it. Like smoke round the fire, some evil always clings to work. We should engage in such works as bring the largest amount of good and the smallest measure of evil. Arjuna killed Bhishma and Drona; if this had not been done Duryodhana could not have been conquered, the force of evil would have triumphed over the force of good, and thus a great calamity would have fallen on the country. The government of the country would have been usurped by a body of proud unrighteous kings, to the great misfortune of the people. Similarly, Shri Krishna killed Kamsa, Jarasandha, and others who were tyrants, but not a single one of his deeds was done for himself. Every one of them was for the good of others. We are reading the Gita by candle-light, but numbers of insects are being burnt to death. Thus it is seen that some evil clings to work.[Source]",
      "Of course, work is always mixed with good and evil, and to work, one has to incur sin, more or less. But what of that? Let it be so. Is not something better than nothing? Is not insufficient food better than going without any? Is not doing work, though mixed with good and evil, better than doing nothing and passing an idle and inactive life, and being like stones? The cow never tells a lie, and the stone never steals, but, nevertheless, the cow remains a cow and the stone a stone. Man steals and man tells lies, and again it is man that becomes a god.[Source]",
      "The scriptures of different religions point out different means to attain the ideals of universal love, freedom, manliness, and selfless benevolence. Every religious sect is generally at variance as to its idea of what is virtue and what is vice, and fights with others over the means of attaining virtue and eschewing vice, instead of aiming at realizing the end. Every means is helpful more or less, and the Gita says, “Every undertaking is attended with defects as fire with smoke”; so the means will no doubt appear more or less defective. But as we are to attain the highest virtue through the means laid down in our respective scriptures, we should try our best to follow them. Moreover, they should be tempered with reason and discrimination. Thus, as we progress, the riddle of virtue and vice will be solved by itself.[Source]",
      "In every country, nations have their good and bad sides. Ours is to do good works in our lives and hold an example before others. No work succeeds by condemnation. It only repels people. Let anybody say what he likes, don’t contradict him. In this world of Maya, whatever work you will take up will be attended with some defect. “All works are covered with defects as fire is with smoke.” Every fire has a chance of being attended with smoke. But will you, on that account, sit inactive? As far as you can, you must go on doing good work.[Source]",
      "Disciple:But, sir, with the spread of learning among them [the masses], they too will in course of time have fertile brains but become idle and inactive like us and live on the fruits of the labour of the next lower classes.",
      "Swamiji:Why shall it be so? Even with the awakening of knowledge, the potter will remain a potter, the fisherman a fisherman, the peasant a peasant. Why should they leave their hereditary calling? “Don’t give up the work to which you were born, even if it be attended with defects.” If they are taught in this way, why should they give up their respective callings? Rather they will apply their knowledge to the better performance of the work to which they have been born. A number of geniuses are sure to arise from among them in the course of time.[Source]",
      "Two things are necessary for the realisation of God: faith and self-surrender.Man is ignorant by nature. Errors are natural to him. Can a one-seer pot hold four seers of milk? Whatever path you may follow, you must pray to God with a restless heart.He is the Ruler of the soul within. He will surely listen to your prayer if it is sincere. Whether you follow the ideal of the Personal God or that of the Impersonal Truth, you will realise God alone, provided you are restless for Him.A cake with icing tastes sweet whether you eat it straight or sidewise.[Source]",

      "In the previous verse, it is said that knowledge leads to the highest devotion; and here it is said that devotion helps to know the Lord in truth, what He is, and who He is. Therefore it is perfectly clear that devotion and knowledge sustain and strengthen each other mutually. The perfect knower of Brahman is also the perfect Bhakta, and the perfected Bhakta is also the sage of supreme wisdom. The great Sankara who propounded the highest truth that there is only One and not two, and so there is neither a devotee nor one to be devoted to, was himself the greatest of devotees, and his prayers, adorations and outpourings of the heart constitute a perennial flood of sweet Bhakti (worship) of the Lord. In the Seventh Chapter seventeenth verse-(‘ekabhaktir visishyate’)it is declared that the sage of true wisdom excels by his single-minded devotion.",
      "Abhijanati:Knows Me well. Knowledge arises from deep love. One cannot truly know anything that he does not love. If he wants to understand the sufferings of the poor he should love them, and that love helps him to know their difficulties, pains and sorrows truly. Mere charity without feeling is not of much value from this point of view. The mother knows the child because she loves him. The devotee knows the Lord, because he loves Him. As this love deepens and when the devotee enjoys the blissful nature of the Lord, he gradually enters that realm of supreme bliss, coming closer and closer to his chosen Deity, till he disappears and the Deity alone remains. It is like the salt doll dissolving in the ocean.",

      "It is declared here that performing actions with devotion to the Lord, man secures His grace, by which deliverance is obtained.‘Sarvakarmanyapi’means only those duties which come to man in the position in which he is placed, and not deeds which are prohibited by the Sastras. Though a man is engaged in the activities of the world with all the senses functioning continuously, if he remembers the Lord or if he surrenders the fruits of his works to the Lord, he obtains the grace of Iswara and liberation comes to him easily. From this, we understand the action performed with true devotion leads man to a state of supreme Bliss. He who takes refuge in the Lord is not bound by any action or by all the actions done continually throughout his life. On the other hand, he breaks the bonds of Karma, for, the binding power of Karma is destroyed by true devotion to the Lord. There is no agency or selfish desire behind such work. Such is of the state of the true devotee whose mind is centered in the Lord and who feels that it is the power of the Lord which is functioning through him. When that attitude of mind is firmly established, man feels not the weight of work, nor the changes of fortune, nor the anxieties of the future.",
      "Just as the court-dancer carrying on her head a brimful pitcher of water, though talking, singing and dancing, keeps her mind on the pitcher to keep it secure, so also the devotee, while engaged in a thousand activities, keeps his mind fixed on the Lord and attains liberation.",
      "The seekers on the path of Karma-yoga should remember this principle. Otherwise, every act binds man to the wheel of Samsara and results in endless strife and suffering. If a man is propelled by selfish desires and performs actions to reap their fruits, he is binding himself with the strongest chains of action and reaction, and birth after birth, he has to undergo all the ills and evils in earthy existence.",
      "Marprasadat:No one can free himself from Maya’s iron chains without Iswara’s grace. Man who is subject to the power of Maya should seek the protection of Iswara who is the Lord of Maya. He, by His grace, liberates man. Therefore everybody should try to win God’s grace. How is God’s grace to be obtained? – By taking refuge in Him, and by sincere self-surrender. The Lord is pleased with such humble surrender. His grace flows into such soul and makes him free and happy. The Lord is not partial to anyone. The devotee approaches the Lord by his self-surrender. The Lord reveals himself to such a man. Thereby, man becomes Divine. So every seeker should engage himself in good works and perform them with devotion and self-surrender.",

      "Question:How should man act in the world?",
      "Answer:He should perform good actions enjoyed by the Sastras, and give away the rewards to the Lord. He should remember the Lord while performing the actions.",

      "Chetasa:The body may be engaged in various activities, but the mind should be clear enough to know that all those actions are resigned to the Lord. So the Lord here teaches resignation of the fruits of actions and not actions themselves. It is useless to give up the actions of the body while the mind wanders always in all directions, thinking of so many worldly things. On the other hand, while the body carries on its prescribed duties, to be thinking of the Lord and giving up the fruits of action to Him, leads to Moksha. Therefore the word ‘chetasa‘ is used here. Knowing that it is the Lord’s power that is running through him and that his actions have no relevance to him except as the work of the Lord, is the secret of Kamayoga.",
      "Buddiyogam:In the Tenth Discourse, the Lord has already declared that. He would bestow ‘buddhiyoga’ on his faithful devotee,(dadami buddhiyogam), Concentration of mind and enquiry into the Self are gifts of God to the devotee. This becomes clear when man attempts to clear the mystery of Self-knowledge. The enquiring mind is disturbed by a hundred doubts and fears, longings, desires and attachments. The path of enquiry is cleared up by God’s grace. The wavering mind is brought to a state of steadiness. One-pointed attention on the Divine becomes possible. The enquirer then finds that the idea of ‘I’ and ‘mine’ are only fictitious creations of the mind, and what exists although is Atma (God).The word ‘satatam‘ shows that the memory of the supreme Reality should be constantly present in the consciousness, for otherwise, Maya would plunge him into Tamas and drag him down to the plane of sense-enjoyments.

Now the Lord points out that even if Arjuna resolves to give up action, he cannot do so, for reason that his own nature will compel him to fight against his own resolve not to do so. The great secret behind all action is the sense of non-doership (i.e.) the absence of agency, in the doer. Man must act some way or other by the force of his nature and habit. How then can he be free from the binding effects of his action? The answer is this-By giving up the sense of doership, and renouncing the fruits of action he can be free. This is the essential secret behind all action. One who has attained this feeling of detachment is not bound by anything that he does.",
      "Swami Vivekananda Says —",
      "First form character, first earn spirituality and results will come of themselves.[Source]",
      "”Each man’s character is determined by the sum total of these impressions. If good impressions prevail, the character becomes good; if bad, it becomes bad. If a man continuously hears bad words, thinks bad thoughts, does bad actions, his mind will be full of bad impressions; and they will influence his thought and work without his being conscious of the fact. In fact, these bad impressions are always working, and their resultant must be evil, and that man will be a bad man; he cannot help it. The sum total of these impressions in him will create the strong motive power for doing bad actions. He will be like a machine in the hands of his impressions, and they will force him to do evil. Similarly, if a man thinks good thoughts and does good works, the sum total of these impressions will be good; and they, in a similar manner, will force him to do good even in spite of himself. When a man has done so much good work and thought so many good thoughts that there is an irresistible tendency in him to do good in spite of himself and even if he wishes to do evil, his mind, as the sum total of his tendencies, will not allow him to do so; the tendencies will turn him back; he is completely under the influence of the good tendencies. When such is the case, a man’s good character is said to be established.[Source]",

Saradananda also engaged him to pack books in the publication department. The Mother was very fond of him, because of his simplicity, honesty, and guilelessness.

Suddenly the Mother turned towards me and asked, “Do you want to say something?” My voice choked. Again she asked with a sign, “Did you come to say something?” Quite involuntarily I blurted out one word, “prasad.” The Mother pointed to the prasad kept on a plate under the bed. Then she resumed the worship. Shivering and perspiring profusely, I ran downstairs with the prasad and found that both swamis were waiting for me anxiously. Swami Shuddhananda asked: “Well, Chandra, could you ask for liberation? What did the Mother say?” I told them what happened. I could not go to the Ganges that day and it took many hours to calm down.",

The Master told him to go to the temple and pray to Her himself for help, assuring him that his request would be granted. Narendra went to the temple with great anticipation. But as soon as he came before the image of the Divine Mother, he saw Her as living and conscious; he forgot the world and the pitiable condition of his mother, sisters, and brothers. In ecstatic joy he prostrated before Her and prayed: “Mother, give me discrimination! Give me renunciation! Give me knowledge and devotion! Grant that I may have an uninterrupted vision of Thee!” He went back to the Master and told him what had happened.The Master sent Narendra to the temple to pray again, but the same thing happened. The third time he remembered his intention, but he felt ashamed to ask for something so small from the Mother of the Universe.

We are jumping!’ The children see it and think the potatoes, egg-plant, and rice are alive and so they jump that way. But the elders, who know, explain to the children that the vegetables and the rice are not alive; they jump not of themselves, but because of the fire under the pot; if you remove the burning wood from the hearth, then they will move no more. Likewise the pride of man, that he is the doer, springs from ignorance. Men are powerful because of the power of God. All becomes quiet when that burning wood is taken away. The puppets dance well on the stage when pulled by a wire, but they cannot move when the wire snaps.",
      "“A man will cherish the illusion that he is the doer as long as he has not seen God, as long as he has not touched the Philosopher’s Stone. So long will he know the distinction between his good and bad actions. This awareness of distinction is due to God’s maya; and it is necessary for the purpose of running His illusory world. But a man can realise God if he takes shelter under His vidyamaya and follows the path of righteousness. He who knows God and realises Him is able to go beyond maya. He who firmly believes that God alone is the Doer and he himself a mere instrument is a jivanmukta, a free soul though living in a body. I said this to Keshab Chandra Sen.”",

      "Nibaddhah:Man is bound by his own thoughts and works (Karma). The Lord knew that Arjuna’s nature as a Kshatriya is to fight. That is why he tells Arjuna that even if he does not wish to fight, he will still engage himself in the battle, prompted to it by his own nature. This is a truth that man thinks and acts according to his nature. If that is so, if man cannot but follow nature, how can there be any prospect of liberation? He was bound in the past and the same will bind him in the present and the future. Is there no way out? There is. The force of nature and human effort are both active forces in one’s life. However much he feels that he is bound by nature, there is the opposite current of thought pointing the way to liberation. The struggle between the two goes on endlessly in the human heart. The Divine Sankaras slowly unfold themeselves and as they become stronger, all the weaknesses of man are overcome in due course. There is no other way. Therefore every man, however, degraded he may be at present, must take an upward curve one time or other. The sooner it is done the better it is for man. But there is no cause for despair in this account. “Perseverance will finally conquer,” says Vivekananda.",

      "Where does the Lord dwell? How does His powers work? These questions are answered here. It is the most foolish delusion of man to think that the Lord is far away, somewhere in the remote sky, and at some such place where man cannot reach. This way of thinking has become a habit of mind for all mankind, except for a very few wise men, who know the secret. The Lord is not away from us. He is with us, in us right in our own heart. That is the Lord’s declaration. He dwells in the heart of all beings, and so one should be very careful in his thought and deeds. He sees all. He is the all-pervasive Atman. He is the dispenser of rewards and punishments for each and every being, according to his Punya and Papa Karma Therefore man should feel the presence of the Lord within and without and try his best to avoid evil and cling to the good only. People must follow the path of truth and righteousness, for, the Lord sees all by His invisible presence everywhere. The Lord’s declaration should inspire hope to the devotee. Where else is he to go to find the Lord who is present in his own heart?",
      "The Lord is present everywhere, and most so in the heart of man. He should be worshipped as the nearest of the near and the dearest of the dear. Without any distinction whatsoever, he is in all beings. The vehicle of manifestation may be a small thing like an ant, or a big thing like an elephant. This does not make any difference at all for the Lord. He is equally present in all, in the sinner as well as in the saint.His presence is felt more where the heart is pure. The difference is only in the degree of manifestation.If the mirror is clear, the sun’s reflection is bright; if the mirror is unclear, the reflection is dim. This makes no difference at all to the Sun.",
      "Yantraudhani:The illusive power of Maya works on all beings. They are moved by Maya in accordance with their own nature. They are like puppets mounted on a machine. As the wheel moves, all the beings move helplessly. They cannot get out of the wheel. The Jivas are bound to the wheel of Samsara, the cycle of birth and death, and rotate helplessly by the inscrutable power of Maya. In the next verse, the Lord points out the way to get out of the wheel. The way is to surrender to the Lord of Maya, who by His grace releases the Jiva from the endless cycle of Samsara.",

What can we do, Madam, He has us on the wheel of life.[Source]",
      "(To Pratap) “Let me tell you something. You are a learned and intelligent and serious-minded soul. Keshab and you were like the two brothers, Gaur and Nitai. You have had enough of lectures, arguments, quarrels, discussions, and dissensions. Can such things interest you any more? Now gather your whole mind and direct it to God. Plunge deep into God.”PRATAP:“Yes, sir, you are right. That is surely my only duty now. But I am doing all these things only to perpetuate Keshab’s name.”MASTER (with a smile):“No doubt you say now that you are doing all this to keep his name alive; but in a few days you won’t feel that way. Listen to a story. A man had built a house on a hill. It was only a mud hut, but he had built it with great labour. A few days after, there came a violent storm and the hut began to rock. The man became very anxious to save it and prayed to the god of the winds, ‘O god of the winds, please don’t wreck the house!’ But the god of the winds paid no heed to his prayer. The house was about to crash. Then he thought of a trick. He remembered that Hanuman man was the son of the god of the winds. At once he cried out with great earnestness: ‘O revered sir, please don’t pull down the house. It belongs to Hanuman. I beseech you to protect it.’ But still the house continued to shake violently. Nobody seemed to listen to his prayer. He repeated many times, ‘Oh, this house belongs to Hanuman!’ But the fury of the wind did not abate. Then he remembered that Hanuman was the devoted servant of Rama, whose younger brother was Lakshmana. Desperately the man prayed, crying aloud, ‘Oh, this house belongs to Lakshmana!’ But that also failed to help matters. So the man cried out as a last resort: ‘This is Rama’s house. Don’t break it down, O god of the winds! I beseech you most humbly.’ But this too proved futile, and the house began to crash down. Whereupon the man, who now had to save his own life, rushed out of it with the curse: ‘Let it go! This is the devil’s own hut!’(To Pratap):“You don’t have to perpetuate Keshab’s name. Remember that he achieved all his success through the will of God. Through the divine will his work was established, and through the divine will it is disintegrating. What can you do about it? Now it is your bounden duty to give your entire mind to God, to plunge deep into the Ocean of His Love.”Saying these words the Master sang in his sweet voice:",
      "Dive deep, O mind, dive deep in the Ocean of God’s Beauty;If you descend to the uttermost depths,There you will find the gem of Love.Go seek, O mind, go seek Vrindavan in your heart,Where with His loving devoteesSri Krishna sports eternally.Light up, O mind, light up true wisdom’s shining lamp,And let it burn with steady flameUnceasingly within your heart.Who is it that steers your boat across the solid earth?It is your guru, says Kubir;Meditate on his holy feet.",
      "The Master continued, addressing Pratap: “Did you listen to the song? You have had enough of lectures and quarrels. Now dive deep into the Ocean of God. There is no fear of death from plunging into this Ocean, for this is the Ocean of Immortality. Don’t think that this will make you lose your head. Never for a moment harbour the idea that by thinking too much of God one becomes insane. Once I said to Narendra —”PRATAP:“Who is Narendra, sir?”MASTER :“Oh, never mind. There is a young man of that name. I said to Narendra: ‘Look here, my boy. God is the Ocean of Bliss. Don’t you want to plunge into this Ocean? Suppose there is a cup of syrup and you are a fly. Where will you sit to sip the syrup?’ Narendra said, ‘I will sit on the edge of the cup and stick my head out to drink it.’ ‘Why?’ said I. ‘Why should you sit on the edge?’ He replied, ‘If I go far into the syrup, I shall be drowned and lose my life.’ Then I said to him: ‘But, my child, there is no such fear in the Ocean of Satchidananda. It is the Ocean, of Immortality. By plunging into It a man does not die; he becomes immortal. Man does not lose his consciousness by being mad about God.",
      "(To the devotees) “The feeling of ‘I’ and ‘mine’ is ignorance. People say that Rani Rasmani built the Kali temple; but nobody says it was the work of God. They say that such and such a person established the Brahmo Samaj; but nobody says it was founded through the will of God.This feeling, ‘I am the doer’, is ignorance. On the contrary, the idea, ‘O God, Thou art the Doer and I am only an instrument; Thou art the Operator and I am the machine’, is Knowledge. After attaining Knowledge a man says: ‘O God, nothing belongs to me — neither this house of worship nor this Kali temple nor this Brahmo Samaj. These are all Thine. Wife, son, and family do not belong to me. They are all Thine.’“To love these objects, regarding them as one’s own, is maya. But to love all things is daya, compassion. To love only the members of the Brahmo Samaj or of one’s own family is maya; to love one’s own countrymen is maya. But to love the people of all countries, to love the members of all religions, is daya. Such love comes from love of God, from daya.“Maya entangles a man and turns him away from God. But through daya one realises God. Sages like Sukadeva and Narada always cherished daya in their hearts.”(Source:Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna)",

    "commentary": [
      "It is said in the previous verse that man is bound to the wheel of Samsara by the power of Maya. What is the way to liberation? How can he attain supreme peace? The answer is given in this verse. To surrender with all his being, whole-heartedly to the Lord who dwells in all beings is the only way to attain freedom from the shackles of Samsara. If anybody wants to stop a machine he must seek the help of the mechanic. The Lord is the mechanic who holds and runs the tremendous machine of Samsara. Therefore Jiva has to take refuge in the Lord if he wants liberation. Without whole-hearted surrender to the Lord, the power of Maya will not give way. Only the power of the Lord is capable of terminating the power of Maya. To none else will Maya give way. Therefore the Lord advises Arjuna to surrender to Him with all his being. This exhortation is for all beings. It is the simplest and easiest path for everyone to follow.All physical powers are subject to the power of Maya and Maya is subject to the power of the Lord. Knowing this, man has to give up pride and egoism and take refuge in the Lord with humility and devotion.The same idea is expressed many times in many places in the Gita. This is one of the central ideas of the Scripture. That the idea of surrender is emphasised in the last verses of the scripture is sufficient proof that it is the major current of thought throughout. Arjuna surrendered to the Lord before the message of Gita is offered to him. The idea is once again brought into a focal point at the end.",
      "Sarvabha-vena:With all his being (i.e.) body, mind and speech. It means that surrender should be complete and unconditional. The whole responsibility is given over to the Lord. The difficulty for the common man is that his surrender generally is conditioned by a secret and silent demand. It is not unreserved. Man’s faith is generally half-hearted. He doubts the mercy of the Lord. He partly wishes to do things by himself, although his life’s experience shows that he has not obtained any great advantage by his own effort. After many many births, man realises that the will of the Lord is supreme, and it is He who is a trustworthy friend and supporter for him in this life, here and now. The sooner man discovers it the better it is for him, for he will then obtain the peace which has been eluding him.",
      "Tat prasadat:By the grace of the Lord. Divine Grace! He who has obtained it, unto him everything is possible. All crookedness shall be straightened for him by the Lord’s grace. He becomes a Dharmatma quickly, says the Lord. How can one obtain God’s Grace? By surrender, with a pure and clear heart, without any reservations, personal ambitions and plans for getting this or that material benefit. What does not man obtain by such surrender? Peace, bliss and liberation from the wheel of Samsara. All the highest aspirations of man are fulfilled by the Lord’s grace.",
      "Param santim: Supreme Peace. The state of Moksha is the highest peace and bliss. It is peace that passeth understanding. It does not depend upon external circumstances. Kings cannot have it. Even emperors cannot hold that peace. It is not any of the different worlds. This peace is in the Atman, who is the real Seer behind all this phenomenal world.The phenomenal world is only an appearance, and attachment to the false, inert and sorrowful would destroy all happiness within. He who disassociates himself from this load of matter, and takes shelter within the Lord finds the treasure of true happiness and peace.",
      "Sasvatam:The bliss of Moksha is eternal. It is changeless and deathless. All other forms of enjoyment in the material world are short-lived, termporary and subject to change. Do we not see from practical experience that pleasure and pain alternately, come down day after day, hour after hour? Of what use is it to cling to them foolishly? ‘Give it up’ is the Lord’s command. By giving up the temporary man attains the eternal state of liberation. It is given only to man to attain this highest state. The human birth is the greatest asset, for, in this manifestation only it is possible for man to attain Moksha. It is difficult for all other manifestations, higher and lower to attain liberation. So, whoever seeks his welfare should surrender to the Lord, obtain His grace, and thereby come up to the highest state of peace and bliss.",
      "If you are strong, take up the Vedanta philosophy and be independent. If you cannot do that, worship God; if not, worship some image. If you lack strength even to do that, do some good works without the idea of gain. Offer everything you have unto the service of the Lord. Fight on! “Leaves and water and one flower — whosoever lays anything on my altar, I receive it with equal delights.” If you cannot do anything, not a single good work, then take refuge [in the Lord]. “The Lord resides within the heart of the being, making them turn upon His wheel.

      "The Lord describes the Gita-Sastra as the most secret of all knowledge. The teachings of this wisdom should be communicated only to such disciples who are qualified to receive it. Arjuna was qualified to receive it by virtue of his great devotion to Krishna, and the virtuous qualities (Daivisampat) that he possessed. Lord Krishna has thereby done a great service to mankind. Even for learning any worldly skill or art, a great deal of preparation is necessary for the student. When that is so, what amount of internal and external preparation is necessary for receiving this highest wisdom, one can easily understand. So the Lord declares that he has taught the most secret wisdom to Arjuna, just because he is fit to receive it, and finds it most necessary in the circumstances in which he is placed.",
      "Vimrisyaita daseshena:Fully reflecting over it. It is the practice of all great teachers to give all that the disciple wants by way of teaching and instruction, and finally leave it to the disciple to decide what he should do, and how he should act. Only the narrow-minded teacher insists on the disciple to accept what he says without doubt or question. On the other hand, the great teachers give complete freedom of thought and reflection to the disciples. Man has to make a free choice of his course of action according to his own nature. The disciple should Know and feel the truth of what was taught to him. Then only he derives the full benefit of the master’s teaching. We see in this context how broad-minded the Lord was when he left the freedom of choice to Arjuna himself. Arjuna was one of the greatest devotees of Krishna. Krishna’s word was law unto him. If Lord Krishna wanted Arjuna to fight in the form of a command, Arjuna would have immediately acted up without any hesitation. But the Lord takes a different view. After giving the full message of wisdom, the Lord asks Arjuna to reflect over it, think well and deeply, and come to a voluntary decision. Such a decision would ultimately benefit him much more than a mere verbal command from the teacher. The final decision is left entirely to the individual.",
      "Yadhecchasi tadha Kuru:Act as you wish. The Lord simply explained the position to Arjuna. That is all. He has nothing more to say. The disciple is free to take it or leave it. Here is a great example of Nishkama-karma. Having taught the Gita Sastra, the Lord leaves it without a thought of the fruit of his action. Although the main objective of the Lord is to make Arjuna fight the battle, He remains unconcerned about the result of his message. The Lord seems to say “you may fight or you may not. That is your decision, not mine. I have taught you the essence of all the Vedas, and it is your duty in the present situation, to take it or leave it. I am unconcerned”. Such is the way how great teachers act in respect of their disciples. Their message is delivered in a simple and powerful way. They pass on, leaving it to the people to think about it, draw their own conclusions and come to their own decision. This is an example of Nishkama-karma with which the scripture comes to a close.",
      "Jnanam akhyyatam:Although in the Gita Sastra, the Lord has dealt with Karma, Bhakti, Dhyana, etc., they are all implied in the simple word wisdom (Jnana). The various paths culminate in Jnana. They are all intended to purify the mind gradually, and the mind so purified by the practice of Karma and Bhakti etc., acquires Jnana by which man attains the highest goal of Moksha. Karma and Bhakti are stepping stones to Jnana. Jnana is the peak point of realisation.",

Therefore the first thing that a disciple should do is to serve the master in every possible way and win his affection and love. By respectaful obedience, by prostration, by personal service, and by humly questioning, the disciple receives the highest knowledge from the Master who offers it to his beloved disciple with love and affection. Spiritual knowledge cannot be purchased or bought by wealth or worldly position or greatness. It is the Master’s gift of love to his disciple.",
      "Arjuna is a true devotee. So he is dear to the Lord. When the mind becomes ripe with true devotion, the Master comes and confers knowledge on his disciple. God leads the disciple to the Master or the Master himself comes in search of the disciple. No true seeker need be disheartened that he is not able to find the Master. The Master would come to him at the appointed time and initiate him into the secrets of spiritual knowledge. Therefore the real seeker should fill his mind with devotion, train himself in the methods of self-control and live a pure life. When such preparation is complete, the Master simply opens the heart of the disciple, and the highest Truth so far concealed in him is revealed to him in a flash.",

      "This is the last verse of the Gita-message. The first part represents‘kilakam’in the Mantra Sastra. The essence of the Gita-message is summed up in this verse. The Vaishnavas repeat it as a Mantra.",
      "Sarvadharman Parityajva:(having abandoned all duties). Surrender to the Lord is the direct path for attaining ultimate liberation. Performing the duties prescribed by the Sastras is no doubt good as it produces ‘Punya’ which takes man to higher worlds. But surrender to the Lord confers Moksha-Liberation. The fruit of all duties and religious observances is implied in surrender. Therefore the Lord advises his disciple to abandon all other duties and attain the highest goal by complete Self-surrender.",
      "Mam Ekam:(Me alone). The fruit of all duties form a part of the infinite bliss of Liberation, as ten forms a part of a hundred. When the stem is watered, all the branches up to the last twig receive nourishment. So the Lord here enjoins complete Self-surrender as the simplest and also the highest method for final Liberation. God is the highest good. By knowing Him (Atma) all else is known, and by attaining Him all the rewards of spiritual life are attained. The fruit of God-realisation is infinite. All finite works and actions are implied in it.",
      "Mokshayishyami:(I will liberate you from all sins). What is the effect of self-surrender? The Dharma Sastras prescribe certain types of penance for the purification of some forms of sin, committed by man in the course of his life, Self-surrender liberates man completely from all sins, innumerable though they may be. In fact, the common man is not aware of how many kinds of sins he is committing every day without his knowledge. So he is bound by his own sins, and wanders through the various worlds, in restless agitation. Such is the fate of the ‘Jiva’ who clings to worldly life and yet hopes for peace which eludes him throughout his life. This restlessness troubles him, continuously till he discovers the only way of liberation from all sins and from all forms of bondage. The Lord here reveals the highest secret. “Surrender to Me; I will liberate you from all sins”, declares the Lord.",
      "Self-surrender should not be a partial affair. It must be complete, without any pre-condition or the least reservation. The river when it joins the ocean does not keep back any part of its separate identity. The union is complete. Thus Self-surrender leads to complete union with the Lord or Atma. The Jivatma becomes Paramatma, and that is the culmination of all spiritual knowledge.",
      "What is the nature of this Self-surrender? It is to withdraw oneself from every kind of worldly attachment. It is to give up all temptation to enjoy the pleasures of this world or the next. It is to abandon all desires. It is to crush the last trace of the ego as a separate entity. Such is the nature of Self-surrender. This cannot be done in a single day. The principle should be properly understood, and continuously practised in everyday life.",
      "It is the divine law that by doing good, man attains joy, and by doing evil he suffers sorrow. Good and evil are mixed up in various proportions in the life of each individual. So joys and sorrows overtake men like the waves of the ocean. This is what we call Samsara. The man who clings to the senses must experience pleasure and pain alternately. Pleasure and pain are inextricably mixed up as the two vital ingredients of human life. So the wise man after experiencing the mixed fruits of his actions through many many births finally gives up the futile and foolish game and turns his mind to God. There he finds the peace which surpasses understanding. This is Liberation.",
      "The devotee, the Bhakta, surrenders to the Lord, and the Jnani, the man who follows the path of discrimination, surrenders to Atma. It may appear as though there is a subtle distinction between the two, the Bhakta and the Jnani, the path of devotion and the path of knowledge through discrimination. The Gita has already made it clear that the distinction is only a verbal difference, and in essence, there is no distinction at all. All paths, Jnana, Bhakti, and Karma, lead to the same goal-Liberation. The basic truth implied in all these paths is renunciation, Tyaga, of the little limited personal ego. The Sastras declare that by Tyaga alone man attains immortality. the",
      "The reader has to understand the statement‘Sarva Dharman parityajya’very carefully. It does not mean that he can remain idle without doing anything at all. If that is so, every idler can claim to be a Brahmajnani a liberated soul. That is not the meaning. The statement means that the individual should surrender the fruits of his Karma and Dharma in the Lord, and by such surrender, he attains Moksha. The lesser duties have to be abandoned by taking to the higher and the highest duty-namely self-surrender.",
      "Ma suchah:(Do not grieve): This is the Lord’s pledge to all his faithful disciples. The Gita actually starts with the words of the Lord‘asochyan anvasochastvam’and ends here with the glorious promise‘ma suchah’. Therefore it is perfectly clear that the purpose of the entire Gita message is to liberate man from the deadly grip of sorrow. Life is a kind of pilgrimage, not from one joy to another, but from one sorrow to another. The wise man knows it, and so he seeks for a joy that does not come to an end, a joy unmixed with sorrow, a joy that is permanent, a joy that fills full the yearning heart, and this he finds in Self-realisation. The ignorant man suffers and continues to suffer through several births, and at last, he too comes to the conclusion that there must be a way out of this vicious circle. Then he hears the mighty call of the Gita “Do not grieve, my friend, surrender to Me and I will liberate you from all sin and sorrow.",
      "The Lord here prescribes the simplest form of discipline to the world as the highest means of ultimate Liberation. So the common man need not worry that he has not read this Sastra or that, that he has not followed this Dharma or that, that he has not performed this sacrifice or that, and so on. In whatever manner he lives, let him surrender to the Lord with truth and sincerity. He shall attain peace and he shall experience the bliss of Liberation.",
      "Hinduism indicates one duty, only one, for the human soul. It is to seek to realise the permanent amidst the evanescent. No one presumes to point out any one way in which this may be done. Marriage or non-marriage, good or evil, learning or ignorance, any of these is justified, if it leads to the goal.[Source]",

      "One day the Holy Mother  Sarada Devi said, “However much of Japa you do, however much of work you perform all is for nothing. If Mahamaya does not open the way, is anything possible for any one? Oh bound soul! Surrender, surrender. Then alone will She take compassion on you and leave your path open.” Saying this, she told an incident in the Master’s life at Kamarpukur. “One day in the month of Jyeshta, there was a heavy rain one evening. The whole field was covered with water. The Master was going along the main road near Dompada wading in the water. There, seeing that many fish had accumulated, people were beating them to death with sticks. One fish kept going round and round the Master’s feet. Noticing it, he said, ‘Hey, do not kill this fish. It is going round my feet, surrendering itself to me. If anybody can, let him take this fish and set it free in the pond.’ Then he himself set it free and came home and said, ‘Ah, if any one could surrender in this manner, then alone can he find protection.’” (Source: Gospel of Holy Mother)",

      "One of the characteristics of a Divine Incarnation is that he gives shelter to those who take refuge in him. His all-encompassing love is not confined to human beings. Even animals find tender shelter with him. Nistarini witnessed this in Sri Ramakrishna. She told Sister Devamata: “Once a cat took refuge in Sri Ramakrishna’s room at Dakshineswara with her little kittens. The mother cat would sometimes sleep on his bed near his feet and if he reached down and touched her with his hand, at once she would get up and seem almost to make pranam [bow before him]. It troubled the Master much to know what to do with the cat and her kittens, for he felt that they did not get proper food at the temple; so one day when I came to see him, he asked me, ‘Will you do something for me?’ I clasped my hands before him and said, ‘Whatever it is, that I must do.’ But again he asked and I replied as before. Then he told me of the cats and asked me to take them. ‘Remember,’ he said, ‘that they have taken refuge with me, so see that they get the best of care.’”",
      "“I took them home and whenever I went to the temple he would question me in every detail about the cats: Were they getting proper food? Had the kittens grown? What did I mean to do with them? He was much concerned lest I might give them away to someone who would not treat them kindly, and again he would remind me, ‘Remember, they took refuge with me.’ The mother cat never had another family. At the end of a year she was suddenly taken ill and died. As she was dying I poured Ganges water into her mouth and repeated Gurumaharaj’s name.” (Source: They Lived with God)",
      "On the way to Dakshineswar Yogin-ma said to the Master: “I want to call on God more and put my mind wholly on Him, but it is hard to control the mind. What shall I do?” Sri Ramakrishna replied in a sweet voice: “Why don’t you surrender to Him? Be like a cast-off leaf in a gale. Do you know what that is like? A cast-off leaf lies on the ground and flies away as the wind carries it. Similarly, one should depend on God. Let the mind move as the power of divine consciousness moves it. That’s all.” (Source: They Lived with God)",
      "Manilal Mallick, a business man, had recently been to Benares, where he owned a bungalow.",
      "MASTER:“So you have been to Benares. Did you see any holy men there?”MANILAL:“Yes, sir. I paid my respects to Trailanga Swami, Bhaskarananda, and others.”MASTER:“Tell us something about them.”MANILAL:“Trailanga Swami is living in the same temple where he lived before — on the Manikarnika Ghat, near the Benimadhav Minaret. People say he was formerly in a more exalted spiritual state. He could perform many miracles. Now he has lost much of that power.”MASTER:“That is the criticism of worldly people.”MANILAL:“Trailanga Swami keeps a strict vow of silence. Unlike him, Bhaskarananda is friendly with all.”MASTER:“Did you have any conversation with Bhaskarananda?”MANILAL:“Yes, sir. We had a long talk. Among other things we discussed the problem of good and evil. He said to me: ‘Don’t follow the path of evil. Give up sinful thoughts. That is how God wants us to act. Perform only those duties that are virtuous.’”",
      "MASTER:“Yes, that is also a path, meant for worldly-minded people. But those whose spiritual consciousness has been awakened, who have realised that God alone is real and all else illusory, cherish a different ideal. They are aware that God alone is the Doer and others are His instruments.“Those whose spiritual consciousness has been awakened never make a false step. They do not have to reason in order to shun evil. They are so full of love of God that whatever action they undertake is a good action. They are fully conscious that they are not the doers of their actions, but mere servants of God. They always feel: ‘I am the machine and He is the Operator. I do as He does through me. I speak as He speaks through me. I move as He moves me.’“Fully awakened souls are beyond virtue and vice. They realise that it is God who does everything.",
      "“There was a monastery in a certain place. The monks residing there went out daily to beg their food. One day a monk, while out for his alms, saw a landlord beating a man mercilessly. The compassionate monk stepped in and asked the landlord to stop. But the landlord was filled with anger and turned his wrath against the innocent monk. He beat the monk till he fell unconscious on the ground. Someone reported the matter to the monastery. The monks ran to the spot and found their brother lying there. Four or five of them carried him back and laid him on a bed. He was still unconscious. The other monks sat around him sad at heart; some were fanning him. Finally someone suggested that he should be given a little milk to drink. When it was poured into his mouth he regained consciousness. He opened his eyes and looked around. One of the monks said, ‘Let us see whether he is fully conscious and can recognize us.’ Shouting into his ear, he said, ‘Revered sir, who is giving you milk?’ ‘Brother,’ replied the holy man in a low voice, ‘He who beat me is now giving me milk.’",

Then I shall be able to drag the cow along.’ So he carried out his intention. But when he killed the cow, the sin of the slaughter fell also on the performer of the sraddha.

Such men are likely to disparage this great and secret knowledge and give false interpretation to the laws enunciated in the Gita. In practical life one comes across many flippant shallow people, engrossed in worldliness, who decry all spiritual knowledge as a foolish exercise in futility. Such men do great harm to society. They destroy faith and create doubts about the truth of this great science. Such men are not only unhelpful but positively harmful to society.",
      "The idea is stated negatively, but its positive meaning is clear. The receiver of this knowledge should possess certain qualities of character. He must have acquired self-discipline by following an austere way of life. He must possess devotion. He must have served elders and teachers, and he should never scorn the wise masters, who deliver this wonderful message.",

The mind acquires power by concentration. If the waters of a lake are disturbed, there cannot be a clear reflection of surrounding trees. A mirror cannot reflect a moving face correctly and clearly. So also, if the mind is unsteady and disturbed, there cannot be a clear reflection of the Reality (Atma). Therefore the Lord questions Arjuna whether he has heard the Gita-teaching with a concentrated mind. One should study the Gita with a concentrated mind. Only then does he understand its meaning clearly. This is no doubt an elementary principle in the study and understanding of any subject. More so, in the study of the Gita which contains the highest spiritual truth. The student has to be extremely alert and concentrated in mind.",

No wonder Arjuna directly perceived the Truth, and his heart was illumined with knowledge.",

He felt a glow of the heart arising from true knowledge. Arjuna stands as a representative of common humanity. The Gita message which destroyed Arjuna’s ignorance and delusion is an unfailing cure for destroying the ignorance of every individual and helping him to realise the highest spiritual truth.",
      "Smritirlabdha:After hearing the Lord’s teaching, Arjuna regained the memory of true Self which he had forgotten under the shadow of temporary delusion. The delusion being removed, he remembered his real nature. He realised in a flash that he was neither the body nor the mind, but the ever pure and ever perfect Atma. Atma is the ever-present Reality in every being. The man who is conscious of this truth is a Jnani, and the man who forgets it is an Ajnani. That is all the difference. But one’s being conscious or not conscious of the Reality does not make any difference at all for the ever-present Atma. It is there all the time, during all the states and conditions which overshadow man’s life from time to time. If a man wears a chain around his neck forgets it and goes about searching for it everywhere, and at last, discovers that. It is all along with him, he is not said to have gained anything at all. His memory is revived, and he finds the chain where was throughout his external search for it. So also, having forgotten the truth that he is Atma, man et Alma, man goes through all the troubles and sorrows of life, and at last he comes to know that what he thought to have lost was always there with him, and he is That (Atma). Such is the experience of Arjuna in the present situation. Sankara says:-",

The Hindu religion has therefore prescribed regular worship of God in various ways and also the service of the Guru in every possible way. By the grace of God and Guru, the bonds of Maya are broken and the seeker attains freedom. Arjuna here declares this ancient truth. By the grace of the Lord, Arjuna threw off the shackles of delusion and realised his original nature.",

He realises that he is no other than the ever pure and ever-perfect Atma. The wrong notion that he is the body is removed by true knowledge. So he says that he would act according to the will of the Lord, free from all doubt and the bondage of ignorance.",

You are the soul, that eternal being. That is your true nature. My job is to de-hypnotize you. This is the true religion.",
      "Delusion vanishes. Delusion regarding one’s own true nature vanishes. We ‘know’ that we are this body and the mind. This knowledge is natural to us. When a person perceives Atman, he gets to know that he is not the body or the mind, but the awareness that precedes all beliefs and perceptions. So, consequent to this experience, will he begin to hate his body and mind? After the perception of Atman, the person will still be able to perceive his body and mind, and entertain a good amount of identification with both. But the dream would have broken down irreparably. It is very difficult to see how much this identification with one’s own body and mind colour our decisions and value system. Since that fundamental identification is changed from body-mind to pure awareness, this person’s decisions and value system will appear to be unique to us. Swamiji says:Each thought we think is tinged with our own character, so that for the pure and holy man, even his jests or abuse will have the twist of his own love and purity and do good.[Source]",

      "The Gita-Sastra is Yoga. Yoga means that which unites. The Jivatman merges into Paramatman by Yoga. So the Gita is said to be Yoga-Sastra. It contains the supreme and most profound secret. Therefore for the seekers of truth, it is the most valuable course of study.",
      "Yogeswarat:Krishna is the Lord of Yoga. One can understand with what kind of deep faith and devotion, he should hear the message of the Gita.",
      "Sakshat:How was Sanjaya sitting in the royal palace able to hear the dialogue taking place on the battlefield of Kurukshetra? Vyasa conferred on Sanjaya the miraculous power of seeing and hearing what was happening at a distance. It is not second-hand information reported to Sanjaya by someone else. He heard it directly. He is communicating it as he heard it for the benefit of humanity.",
      "Question:What is the greatness of the Gita?",
      "Answer:It contains the most profound spiritual secret. It is directly declared by the Lord Himself."

      "Sanjaya says that he recalled to mind the Gita-message again and again. It means that the devotee should not be satisfied with a mere reading of the text, but must think of it, again and again, many times in order to understand its true meaning and significance. This is called “Manana” in the Sastras. Hearing is the first stage. Thinking of what is heard repeatedly is the second stage. And the third stage is being established in the idea firmly. It is only then that the seeker gets the full reward for his study. The reward is true joy-(ananda), which every man is seeking here and there in the objective world, but which he can attain only by true knowledge and devotion to God.",
      "Punyam:The Gita is a scripture. It destroys all evil that envelops the human mind.",
      "Muhurmuhuh:Sanjaya rejoices again and again. At the moment of Self-realisation or at the moment of union with the Supreme, man experiences a state of ecstasy. Arjuna started at first as a frail mortal with his mind clouded by sorrow. At the end, the same Arjuna becomes a very different man. He attains Self-knowledge and plunges into righteous action without fear and sorrow. So also Sanjaya thinks of the Gita-message again and again with indescribable joy.",

      "Question:What is the fruit of such meditation on the Gita?",
      "Answer:The devotee is filled with joy and experiences the bliss of Atma Jnana."

    "commentary": [
      "In the previous verse, Sanjaya described the joy of hearing the Lord’s message. Here he expresses his astonishment when he saw the wondrous form of Krishna. “I rejoice again and again,” says Sanjaya. Great is his astonishment when he remembers the Universal form of the Lord. The little small world in which man lives is forgotten for the time being, and the devotee actually sees the mighty infinite Virat form of God. When this vision appears, the devotees are filled with overflowing joy that is above all other joys that he finds in the ordinary objects of the world. In that state of ecstasy, some sing, some dance, and some are plunged into deep silence.",

      "Answer:It is most wonderful.",

    "commentary": [
      "This is the last verse of the Gita. All the most precious rewards of life, victory, peace and prosperity, come to the man who feels in his heart the presence of Krishna and Arjuna.",
      "Krishna is the Lord of Yoga. Arjuna is the wielder of the bow, Gandiva. He is not only a hero on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. but he is also a devotee who conquered the inner enemies of delusion and ignorance. The knowledge of the Gita is like Gandiva in the hands of Arjuna. Knowledge, devotion and action are the mighty weapons in his battle with ignorance. Victory is thus assured for the true devotee.",
      "Dhanurdharah:(the wielder of the bow) The word indicates the Yoga of action (Karma Yoga). In fact, Arjuna understood the secret of Karma-yoga by the teaching of the Gita. He plunged into action and obtained victory.",
      "Yogeswarah:(The Lord of Yoga) Krishna is the embodiment of all the paths of Yoga Bhakti, Jnana, Karma and Dhyana.",
      "There is a common notion that wisdom and action are contradictory terms. They are not. There is no conflict between wisdom and action. A man can live in the world surrounded by the numerous duties and obligations of life, and yet enjoy the bliss of supreme peace within himself. He is the perfect man who combines wisdom and action in his life. The Lord has already said that no man could live without action even for a moment. One sees it directly in his life. Men are acting continuously. How to achieve peace in this world of action? That is the most important question. The Gita gives a convincing answer to that question. This last verse which brings Krishna and Arjuna together into one focal point is a visible representation of Jnana and Karma, the actionless Brahman represented by Krishna, and action represented by Arjuna.",
      "Everyone wants victory, peace, and prosperity. How can he achieve them? The answer is by worshipping Krishna as the Lord of Yoga, and Arjuna as the wielder of the bow, that is, by knowledge and action combined in the everyday conduct of life.",
      "Sanjaya makes it clear to Dhritarashtra that victory is on the side of the Pandavas as they are following the righteous path.",
      "The company of holy men is also most beneficial in the spiritual progress of man. May the devotees of the Gita remember this verse at all times, and thereby enjoy the highest rewards of life.",
      "Sanātana Dharma will never perish. The very name suggests this. It is held by the Lord. If we hand our body-mind to Him, His Grace fills it with the waters of the Divine, and we will find our life becoming a thick cloud that showers dharma. No one can harm such a person.When Duryodhana asked Bhishma to kill Arjuna, the grandsire emphatically said, “It is impossible! Who can harm a person who is protected by the protector of the world—yasya goptā jagat-goptā!”"
