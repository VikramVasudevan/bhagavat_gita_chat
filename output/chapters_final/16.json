    "commentary": [
      "The Gita gives prominence to practise (sadhana). The spiritual goal is very near when the mind is purified. So the manner and means of purifying the mind are clearly stated in many places and here,‘daivisampat’is particularly intended to teach the disciple the science of self-purification. Twenty-six qualities are mentioned here. The aspirant for Moksha like the good student at his desk, should cultivate those qualities with determination and assiduous practice (abhyasa). He should not only acquire them but protect them as one would protect a treasure safely, never allowing anything to drop away from it.",
      "Daivisampat is divine wealth, and the Lord scatters it among the people at large and says, “O ye mortals! Do not set your heart in worldly treasures, do not get entangled in the meshes of sense-enjoyments, for they shall cause misery birth after birth. Here are the precious jewels of spiritual illumination. Take them, take them all, for they are yours, and you shall be truly rich and wealthy when you possess them.” Therefore the wise and the thoughtful should quickly take hold of the treasure, and with the knowledge treasure attain oneness with Paramatma!",
      "Abhayam:Among all the virtues, the Lord first takes up what may be described as the ‘lion’ among good qualities-fearlessness (abhayam). One should pause and think why fearlessness is given the first place among a number of other virtues equally great and adorable. (1) Fear is the source of all evil, and from fear arises all other bad qualities. Men cheat, betray, fight, kill, dominate, suppress truth, and do every evil thing, out of fear. All weakness is caused by fear. Man suffers misery by fear. Men cling to this life, wife and children, houses and positions on account of fear. The whose Samsara is built on fear. So if this tear is eradicated all other evil and weakness, disappear gradually. Fearlessness will bring with it all the other shining virtues which lead to liberation. So it is the virtue ofdaivisampat. In the game of Tug-of-war, the first man and the last man are selected for their strength and weight. In this tug-of-war with the evil forces, fearlessness is chosen as the captain to lead the team of virtues on the battle-field of everybody’s heart. The Upanishads declare that abhayam, is the state of Brahman.",
      "Thus, Abbayam, the first virtue declared by the Lord should be practised by every seeker for spiritual realisation.",
      "Sattvasamsuddhih:Perfect purity of the mind is stated next. The mind should be as pure as the purest mirror. Not a speck of dust should be there. Not a trace of worldly thoughts, sensual tendencies, vicious inclinations should be there. As the mind gets pure, the Atmic light is clearly perceived in it. True knowledge and joy fills the mind.",
      "Jnanayogavyavasthitah:Though different yogas are taught in the Gita, here and there the superior excellence of jnanayoga is mentioned as Atmajnana, which is the goal of spiritual life. (Sarvam karmakhilam Partha jnane parisamapyate.) All works and yogas culminate in jnana. Therefore the Lord mentions it in the beginning, and the seekers should take to knowledge and cross over delusion and ignorance.",
      "Danam:Charity which includes every kind of help offered to others without expectation of any return from them. Gift of lands, money, food, water service, education, knowledge, all offerings come under, ‘danam.’",
      "Damah:The control of the internal organs is included in ‘Sattva samsuddhih‘, and so here the control of external organs is mentioned. Self-restraint both internal and external is the pre-requisite of all spiritual progress. Proper emphasis is given to these virtues in the Gita.",
      "Yajnah:Tapo-yajna, yoga-yajna, svadhyaya-yajna, jnana-yajna these are the yajnas most necessary for spiritual life.",
      "Svadhyayah:The study of the Gita, Upanishads, Brahmasutras, Yoga-Vasishta, Bharata, Bhagavata, Ramayana, etc., and books of this type should be read and their essence absorbed through deep thought and meditation. This is Svadhyaya.",
      "Tapah:This is explained in the17th Discourse. It is absolute purity in word, thought and deed and not the mortification of the flesh.",
      "Arjavam:Straight-forwardness in thought, word and deed. This is called ‘Trikaranasuddhi,’ – because thinking, speaking and acting form the triple function of all men. Where there is harmony among the three, there is truth. Poisonous reptiles are crooked in their movements, and hence if man is crooked in his character, he is like a reptile.",
      "Ahimsa:Non-injury towards any creature in thought, word or deed.",
      "Satyam:1. Truth in thought word and deed, 2. Adherence in Atma, the One Reality.",
      "Akrodhah:Absence of anger. Krodha is man’s deadly foe in every way. obsessed by it man loses all discrimination and destroys himself by cruel behaviour towards elders and Gurus. So the Lord has already warned man against it (Krodhat bhavati sammohah). Under its power man is transformed into a demon, horrible to look at, with red eyes, sweating, shaking abusing and attacking. Freedom from this Demon is therefore the primary duty of man in his life, both secular and spiritual.",
      "Tyagah:Tyagenaike amṛtatva manasuḥ– By Tyaga alone, Moksha is attained – so says the Upanishads. Taking refuge in Paramatma by giving up attachment for objects is tyaga. Giving up evil thoughts, evil actions, evil ways of life, is tyaga. Renunciation of all desires for enjoyments is tyaga. Surrendering all the fruits of actions to God is tyaga. Internal renunciation is of more significance than formal external renunciation.",
      "Santih:Peace, calmness of mind. The mind should be like a waveless lake and not like a turbulent ocean. Perfect peace is attained only when the mind merges in Atma. Where there is no peace there is no happiness (asantasya kutah sukham). Taking refuge in God and giving up desires is the way to peace.",
      "Apaisunam:Not pointing out bad qualities in others, not carrying tales against others. Why should one concerned with the evil of others? It is enough if he cleanses his own heart filled with innumerable evils.",
      "Daya bhuteshu:Kindness and compassion towards all beings are mentioned several in the Gita. Brahmajnana is most closely associated with universal compassion. The seekers should cultivate this virtue along with Bhakti, Jnana and Vairagya.",
      "Alolatvam:Indulgence in several pleasures should be abandoned completely. The sense-organs lose their power by yielding to the temptations of the flesh and are incapacitated to think and grasp higher truths. So they should be withdrawn from sense-objects (pratyahara) and established in Atma. The mind should not waver from the chosen ideal.",
      "Mardavam:Gentleness in word and deed. Hardness and harshness should be abandoned. This is the attitude of a man of Sattvic nature.",
      "Hrih:This is the mark of an evolved human being. 1. He is ashamed of himself if he does anything wrong, when he utters a lie, or when he injures another, or when he acts contrary to Sastraic injunction. 2. The seeker should question himself about his spiritual progress, and when he has not made proper advance, he should feel ashamed of his niggardly and sluggish attempts in securing his own good. 3. When one comes across great men of purity and perfection, experienced in Brahmajnana, he should feel ashamed of himself, and strive for perfection like them.",
      "Achapalam:The wandering mind should be brought to rest in Atma.",
      "Tejah:The light of Brahman.",
      "Kshama:Forbearance, forgiveness. One should think of God-men like Suka and their exceptional forbearance and love for all. When the pairs of opposites overtake him he should remain firm and unmoved.",
      "Dhritih:The seekers should be steadfast and firm. As man thinks of the unreality of the world and the blessedness of Paramatma, he becomes bold and firm in all the functions of his life. Like the Meru mountain, he should be immovable under the most difficult circumstances.",
      "Saucham:1. External purity of the person, house etc., 2. Internal purity of the senses and the mind, and freedom from bad thoughts and feelings.",
      "Adrohah:Abandoning hatred and betrayal of others.",
      "Natimanita:One should not be proud and imagine that he should be adored and worshipped by others. This is a very important point for all seekers to remember. Lacking in this, many advancing souls in spiritual life have fallen down before attaining Self-realisation.",
      "One should think of Hanuman, his humility and devotion, his egolessness, his utter self surrender to Rama. Such a man alone can achieve the Highest.",
      "Thus Daivisampat includes twenty-six virtues. These should be cultivated carefully and assiduously by all people who wish to advance in spiritual life.",
      "Question:How many and what are the qualities of Daivisampat?",
      "Answer:They are twenty-six 1. Fearlessness, 2. purity of heart, 3. steadfastness in knowledge and yoga, 4. alms-giving, 5. control of the senses, 6. sacrifice 7. Study of the Sastras, 8. austerity, 9. straightforwardness, 10. harmlessness, 11. truth, 12. absence of anger 13. renunciation 14. peacefulness, 15. absence of crookedness, 16. compassion to beings, 17. absence of greed, 18. gentleness, 19. modesty, 20. absence of fickleness, 21. engergy, 22. forgiveness 23. fortitude, 24. purity 25. absence of hatred, 26. absence of pride these are the qualities born of a divine state."

      "Jnanayogavyavasthitah:Though different yogas are taught in the Gita, here and there the superior excellence of jnanayoga is mentioned as Atmajnana, which is the goal of spiritual life. (Sarvam karmakhilam Partha jnane parisamapyate.) All works and yogas culminate in jnana. Therefore the Lord mentions it in the beginning, and the seekers should take to knowledge and cross over delusion and ignorance.",
      "Danam:Charity which includes every kind of help offered to others without expectation of any return from them. Gift of lands, money, food, water service, education, knowledge, all offerings come under, ‘danam.’",
      "Damah:The control of the internal organs is included in ‘Sattva samsuddhih‘, and so here the control of external organs is mentioned. Self-restraint both internal and external is the pre-requisite of all spiritual progress. Proper emphasis is given to these virtues in the Gita.",

      "Svadhyayah:The study of the Gita, Upanishads, Brahmasutras, Yoga-Vasishta, Bharata, Bhagavata, Ramayana, etc., and books of this type should be read and their essence absorbed through deep thought and meditation. This is Svadhyaya.",
      "Tapah:This is explained in the17th Discourse. It is absolute purity in word, thought and deed and not the mortification of the flesh.",
      "Arjavam:Straight-forwardness in thought, word and deed. This is called ‘Trikaranasuddhi,’ – because thinking, speaking and acting form the triple function of all men. Where there is harmony among the three, there is truth. Poisonous reptiles are crooked in their movements, and hence if man is crooked in his character, he is like a reptile.",

So the Lord has already warned man against it (Krodhat bhavati sammohah). Under its power man is transformed into a demon, horrible to look at, with red eyes, sweating, shaking abusing and attacking. Freedom from this Demon is therefore the primary duty of man in his life, both secular and spiritual.",
      "Tyagah:Tyagenaike amṛtatva manasuḥ– By Tyaga alone, Moksha is attained – so says the Upanishads. Taking refuge in Paramatma by giving up attachment for objects is tyaga. Giving up evil thoughts, evil actions, evil ways of life, is tyaga. Renunciation of all desires for enjoyments is tyaga. Surrendering all the fruits of actions to God is tyaga. Internal renunciation is of more significance than formal external renunciation.",
      "Santih:Peace, calmness of mind. The mind should be like a waveless lake and not like a turbulent ocean. Perfect peace is attained only when the mind merges in Atma. Where there is no peace there is no happiness (asantasya kutah sukham). Taking refuge in God and giving up desires is the way to peace.",

      "Alolatvam:Indulgence in several pleasures should be abandoned completely. The sense-organs lose their power by yielding to the temptations of the flesh and are incapacitated to think and grasp higher truths. So they should be withdrawn from sense-objects (pratyahara) and established in Atma. The mind should not waver from the chosen ideal.",
      "Mardavam:Gentleness in word and deed. Hardness and harshness should be abandoned. This is the attitude of a man of Sattvic nature.",
      "Hrih:This is the mark of an evolved human being. 1. He is ashamed of himself if he does anything wrong, when he utters a lie, or when he injures another, or when he acts contrary to Sastraic injunction. 2. The seeker should question himself about his spiritual progress, and when he has not made proper advance, he should feel ashamed of his niggardly and sluggish attempts in securing his own good. 3. When one comes across great men of purity and perfection, experienced in Brahmajnana, he should feel ashamed of himself, and strive for perfection like them.",
      "Achapalam:The wandering mind should be brought to rest in Atma.",
      "Tejah:The light of Brahman.",
      "Kshama:Forbearance, forgiveness. One should think of God-men like Suka and their exceptional forbearance and love for all. When the pairs of opposites overtake him he should remain firm and unmoved.",
      "Dhritih:The seekers should be steadfast and firm. As man thinks of the unreality of the world and the blessedness of Paramatma, he becomes bold and firm in all the functions of his life. Like the Meru mountain, he should be immovable under the most difficult circumstances.",
      "Saucham:1. External purity of the person, house etc., 2. Internal purity of the senses and the mind, and freedom from bad thoughts and feelings.",
      "Adrohah:Abandoning hatred and betrayal of others.",
      "Natimanita:One should not be proud and imagine that he should be adored and worshipped by others. This is a very important point for all seekers to remember. Lacking in this, many advancing souls in spiritual life have fallen down before attaining Self-realisation.",

      "The Lord describes the progress of these wicked men after they are hurled into demonical wombs. They do not attain Him because they are deluded.

Hearing this exhortation of the Lord, and the graphic description of the fate of evil doers, who would not wake up to the realities of life and action? Who would not turn away from evil? Who would not surrender to the Lord? Who would not pray to Him to be saved? We can understand why the Lord presents the fate of evil-doers so picturesquely, so intensely and with such terrific force. He warns mankind, a terrible warning it is indeed which only the most abandoned souls could fail to understand. Let mankind wake up to truth, and know where they are, what they are, and what their fate would be.

      "The wise value the good qualities described as Daivisampat and try to cultivate them in their life. Opposed to this, men of demonical nature embrace the wicked qualities mentioned in this verse. That is why they are spoken of asAsurasamapat. Really speaking, the demonical state is not sampat (treasure) at all. And yet people are so deluded that they hug these wicked qualities and think of themselves as great men. The Lord mentions six qualities of the demonical nature. They are elaborately discussed in this discourse. In the great war with Maya, it is necessary to know and understand the power of the enemy forces as well as the forces of one’s own. Only then it would be possible to wage successful war with the enemy. If anybody wants to live in a house, he should first of all clean it of the dust, cobwebs and other foul things, and then light some scented sticks to purify the atmosphere. So also, man should keep the body pure, the foul things in it should be ejected and nourishing food should be taken in. In the same manner, purity of mind should be cultivated by abandoning the bad qualities which have been possessing the heart for a long time in one’s ignorant state. The removal of vicious taints from nature and the formation of healthy patterns of character and conduct, is the duty of all men.",
      "Dambhah:Pretension is mentioned as the captain of the enemy forces (Asurasampat). The inclination to appear bigger and greater than what one is, is natural to all common people. This tendency should be checked completely as it stands directly in the way of the seeker, whose aim is to know the real Self, and not masquerade under a false grab. Such pretension may cheat the world but not Paramatma, who is ever-present in the heart and observing every movement of the mind and the body. So this demonical quality should be eradicated. If honour and position come to anyone, he should consider it to be the grace of God, and remain humble. Besides this, Krodha (wrath) should be abandoned completely. The man of Divine nature is free from wrath. He should be gentle in word and deed. Starting with Dambha the asuric nature ends with ignoranceajnana, as the last. Out of ignorance grows the demonical nature with all its evil qualities.",
      "Question:What are the qualities of the Demonical nature?",
      "Answer:They are six: 1. Pretension, 2. pride, 3. self conceit, 4. hatred, 5. harshness, 6. ignorance.",
      "Question:How should one deal with these?",
      "Answer:They should be rejected and totally eradicated from the mind."

      "Having described the divine and demonical nature, the Lord now declares the fruits of each. When a man knows the effects of the things, he is induced to accept things, which yield good results and abandon others which yield bad results. Divine nature leads to liberation, the demonical leads to bondage. The two natures function in opposite directions and yield opposite results. One liberates and the other binds, enslaves. The thoughtful know what to choose, between freedom and slavery. No one wants pain and suffering, ignorance and darkness, slavery and bondage. Therefore it is our duty to dispel darkness with light, to remove ignorance with knowledge, and to crush demonical nature with divine.",
      "These two hostile natures, the divine and the demonical are not racial or national or family qualities. After a man is born, these two natures develop gradually in him. By right type of control, guidance and training, the mind falls into the groove of divine qualities, and then it attains the highest rewards of self-realisation. On the other hand, if the mind falls into the wrong groove, it acquires all evil qualities and the man falls into lower planes of life. Arjuna is assured by the Lord Himself, that he is born for divine nature and full of divine qualities. Otherwise, how could he receive the supreme truth directly from the lips of the Lord Himself?",
      "Ma suchah:‘Do not grieve.’ This is the Gita message, simple, straight, direct and decisive. “O Arjuna! you are born for the divine nature and therefore, do not grieve.” From this, it is clear that the cultivation of good qualities, purity of mind, is the way to peace and bliss. It is also clear that the demonical nature is the cause of sorrow, misery and death. Therefore the aspirants for spiritual light should strive for divine nature and resolutely abandon the demonical impulses.",

    "commentary": [
      "Dushpuram:Desire is insatiable. The more it is fed, the more it wants. Its hunger multiplies with every enjoyment. In the3rd Discourse, the Lord has already described it as ‘insatiable like fire’ (duṣhpūreṇānalena cha). Therefore those who are enslaved by it, lead a restless and frustrated life.",
      "Dambhamanamadanvitah:Pride, self-conceit, arrogance, these are the real enemies of man, separating him from all others by the assertion of superiority. Why should man subject himself to these evils? The answer is given – mohat. Ignorance is the cause. He deludes, denies truth, accepts, false ideas, and does things which ought not to be done.",
      "Asuchivratah:Vrata refers generally to vows of a sattvic nature, like fasting, silence etc. Such are (Suchi-Vratas) auspicious vows helpful to man in self-purification. But men of demonical nature adopt impure and unholy habits like flesh-eating, liquor and persist in them as sacred practices. Determination, performance of vows are no doubt good, but it should be for pure and sacred purposes and not for foul and unholy things.",
      "Question:What is the nature of Kama?",
      "Answer:It is insatiable.",
      "Question:What further are the qualities of persons having demonical nature?",
      "Answer:1. They yield to insatiable desires, 2. They are the victims of pride. self-conceit and arrogance, 3. They are ignorant, 4. They adopt impure and unholy vows."

      "The worldly man finds no end to his desires, wants, and enjoyments. They can end only with the man’s death, or the dissolution of the world. Let us understand clearly that desires do not end themselves at any time. They should be cut by the sword of discrimination and burnt in the fire of Jnana. Otherwise, they continue forever. Being ignorant and deluded by Maya, they think and decide that there is nothing more than sensual enjoyment in the world, there is no such thing as Dharma or Moksha, and Artha and Kama alone exist for man. They see nothing beyond the body and the senses and so they conclude that sense-enjoyments, and bodily pleasures, are the only things to be sought in the world. They are enslaved by innumerable desires. And so they have no rest or peace of mind. The desires clamour for satisfaction, and to satisfy the desires, they should have wealth. To secure the means of enjoyment they follow unrighteous means; By treachery, falsehoods etc., they get wealth and spend it on securing physical enjoyments. Thus they live a life of kama (lust) and krodha (anger), for, where there is kama, kordha follows as its closest associate.",

These words reveal the pride, greed, hatred, lust and delusion of these men of demonical nature.",
      "Desires are never satisfied by enjoyment. With every luxury provided, more desires crop up for more refined luxuries. Wealth finds no end for the greedy men. He calculates what he has and hopes to get more and more in future. His mind is full of plans, plots and schemes to get more money by crooked means. He is proud of his power. He says ‘I have killed this enemy and other enemies also I shall destroy.’ So he is puffed up with the idea of his own invincibility. He thinks he is mighty and happy, born in a great family, the Lord of all, strong, powerful, unequal to any other. Who is there equal to me?’ is his challenge to the world.",
      "What is the end for all this demonical pride, hatred and lust? The end is hell. Foul hell. Such men go down into the lowest worlds. They have no rest or peace, for, their minds are like the ocean tempest, lost by the winds of desires and bashed by lustful passions of sensual enjoyments. They appear to be great men, because they are wealthy and powerful, but if one has a glimpse into their self, he finds that they are like men stung by a hundred scorpions. If they do sacrifices and offer gifts, it is all done for self-glorification only. There is no truth in them. The bloated ego puffed up with pride, dominates them to such an extent that they declare themselves ‘I am Isvara’.",
      "They are deluded by ignorance. The ‘rajasic’ nature over-powers them and ignorance (tamas) shrouds them in complete darkness, and they are unable to understand the true end of human life. They have no idea of the true nature of men and the world, and the Supreme behind all. They are deeply attached to earthly objects and live a life of restless ecstasy.",
      "The true nature of the ‘sattvic’ man who is pure-hearted is never understood by them. Even if it is explained to them, they will not understand it. They consider the great teachers of the world as mad-caps, and their message as empty and foolish. What is their fate? The Lord emphatically declares that such men fall into foul Hell. That is the right royal road to Hell, the primrose path to eternal bonfire. Let the spiritual aspirants beware of it.",

      "Evidently, the teacher of the Gita wants His disciple to understand the horrible nature and the terrible fate that shall overtake such men. Nothing can save such men from self-destruction. They may be rich, powerful and learned also, but nothing can change the course of their life, because they deny the existence of Paramatma and consider life only as a field for sensual gratification. Mere cleverness, worldly intelligence and wisdom do not take them outside the category of the Rakshasas. They possess many powers as we find in the case of Ravana and Hiranyakaspu, but they are ignorant of the one basic truth, namely, that all they possess is derived from the Lord Himself, and d He is the supreme Purusha present in all beings. These demonical characteristics poison the hearts of many people in this world. Such men are all Rakshasas in the human form. The impure impluses of kama and krodha are demons having taken possession of man’s being. The seekers should thoroughly search their hearts and find out these dark and evil spirits, and drive them out by the sheer force of will and the grace of the Lord. The sattvic power of men is capable of destroying these rajasic and tamasic forces. The sattvic power has already been described by the Lord as Daivisampat, beginning with abhayam as its’ first principle. These divine qualities should be grafted into one’s own nature and as they grow stronger and stronger, the enemical forces are quelled and vanquished. Victory will be sure.",
      "The scriptural call for the divine, ‘Oye Devas! come, O ye Rakshasas go’ – should be followed by all the aspirants. The evil spirits should quit and the Divine beings should come to occupy the heart. Thus man’s heart is transformed into the temple of God, in which Atmajnana dawn in due time."

      "The Lord reiterates what has been said already. Kama, krodha, and lobha form the triple opening into Hell. They are the three evils (Dushtatrayam) which directly lead man into the lower worlds. When these gates are shut by dispassion, love and detachment, there is no fear for man. The demonical qualities so elaborately described so far, are epitomised and classified into three essential evils 1. Desire, 2. Wrath, 3. Greed. Desire is to be conquered by dispassion, wrath by love, greed by discrimination and detachment. There is hope for the awakened souls who have become conscious of the evils in them, and the horrible future that awaits them if they do not destroy these evils. Striving for purity and the higher way of life they shall shut down the gateway to Hell. These evils lurking in the heart like thieves in darkness should be detected by the torch-light of knowledge and should be driven out with the help of the Divine qualities.",

      "So long as the triple evil of desire, anger, and greed poison the heart of man, he cannot do any good. He cannot accomplish his own well-being. Therefore man should first purify his heart by reducing and eliminating these corrosive evils. Then he spontaneously rises to higher planes of spiritual life and attains Moksha. Like the sun and moon freed from the darkening grip of Rahu and Ketu, like the Gajendra freed from the death hold of the crocodile (Makara), like the prisoner brought out into the sunlight from the darkness of the prison-cell, the Jiva should liberate himself from the strange-hold of those three evils. He should become vimuktah (i.e) completely free from them. The idea is that there should not be any trace of these evils anywhere in the mind. They are the gateways of darkness (i.e) they are forms of ignorance (avidya) where there is no gleam of light, where everything is plunged in darkness. Such a man is like one living in a closed house full of darkness. He lives in sorrow and perishes in sorrow.",
      "Acharatyatmanah sreyah:The well-being of self requires thoughtful discrimination of the real and the unreal. What is this life? What is the world? What is the end and aim of life? These questions arise in the mind of the sattvic man who is partially awakened to find out the truth. But the man who is possessed by lust, anger and greed, cannot think of these things at all, because his whole mind is absorbed in sensual cravings, is agitated by anger, and confounded by inordinate greed. So, the seeker should keep away from these evils and that is in itself the great good that man can do unto himself. For, where these evils are not, the mind is pure, and when the mind is pure, he enjoys bliss of the Self.",

      "Indisciplined conduct under the impulse of one’s own desires and passions is condemned here. We come across people who act in their own way and try to make a philosophy out of it. This is wrong. It is only a mask to cover up their own unbridled passions and evil desires. They deny the authority of the Sastras, because they are deluded by ignorance and agitated by sensual desires. The Sastras embody the laws of life both secular and spiritual, which have been discovered after long research into the meaning and purpose of human life by the greatest of men, the Rishis, whose only aim was the welfare of humanity. They stated the laws following which man attains the best things in secular life and the highest goal in spiritual life. So, every true seeker should test his way of life, his thoughts, feelings and actions by referring them to the scriptural laws. Where they do not conform to the Sastras, they should be checked and restrained, and right methods should be adopted. The Lord declares that no good can be achieved by acting contrary to the commands of the Sastras, because the Sastras express the will of God. So, the seekers should carefully study the Sastras and mould their life accordingly, so that they can secure both worldly happiness and spiritual realisation.",

As it is declared in the previousverse, man can achieve all the good things of life, happiness and moksha also, if he acts strictly according to the scriptural injunctions. Action contrary to them leads to unhappiness, frustration, and death. One can understand how the Lord values the Vedas and the Sastras, when He, Paramatma Himself declares them to be the highest authority.
