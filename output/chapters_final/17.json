    "commentary": [
      "It was declared that action contrary to Sastraic commands cannot lead to perfection (16.23&16.24). But there are people who have not read the Sastras either by indifference or incompetence or other reasons, and yet who believe in a higher power and carry on some form of worship and perform sacrifices. These men are different from the demonical type because the latter entirely denies the existence of the Higher power. These people have faith, but it is not in conformity with the Sastras. What is their condition? What is the nature of their worship? This is Arjuna’s question."

    "commentary": [
      "The mind (the inner organ) is alone the Jiva (man). So if the mind is pure, purity becomes the essence of that man. Here the word ‘sattva‘ means mind. Every individual acquires that nature which he has brought with him from his experience in former births. And his faith takes on that quality only. He is that faith, qualified by his Samskaras. So it is the duty of man to instill Sattvic disposition into his character and by practice transcend that also to reach the highest state. The Tamasic and Rajasic kinds of Sraddha should be abandoned, because they also pull man downwards into lower forms of existence. Among the qualities, Sattva is the nearest to Atma, and in Suddha-sattva, man directly perceives Atma, and enters the Nirguna state. That is the real Self of man, that is his final goal.",
      "What I think is practical, is to me the only practicality in the world. If I am a shopkeeper, I think shopkeeping the only practical pursuit in the world. If I am a thief, I think stealing is the best means of being practical; others are not practical. You see how we all use this word practical for things we like and can do. Therefore I will ask you to understand thatVedanta, though it is intensely practical, is always so in the sense of the ideal.[Source]",
      "The Bhagavad Gita states: “A man consists of the faith that is in him. Whatever his faith is, he is.” A man of faith is free from fear, worry, and anxiety. Once there was a terrible fire in a neighbour’s house which was only fifteen yards from his own. A strong wind was blowing and occasionally sparks fell on Nag Mahashay’s roof. While the villagers were fighting to stop the blazing fire, Nag Mahashay stood before it with folded hands, unperturbed. Sharatkamini, however, was frightened and started throwing clothes, bedding, and blankets outside. Seeing her, Nag Mahashay cried out: “Shame on you! Still you have no faith in God! Brahma, the god of fire, has come. Instead of worshipping him, you are busy protecting these trifling objects! Victory to Sri Ramakrishna!” He started to dance in the courtyard. Then he added, “If God protects, no one can destroy; and if God destroys, no one can save.” The neighbour’s house was burned to the ground, but Nag Mahashay’s house remained undamaged. (Source: They Lived with God)",
      "“One looks on God exactly according to one’s own inner feeling.Take, for instance, a devotee with an excess of tamas. He thinks that the Divine Mother eats goat. So he slaughters one for Her. Again, the devotee endowed with rajas cooks rice and various other dishes for the Mother. But the sattvic devotee doesn’t make any outer show of his worship. People don’t even know he is worshipping. If he has no flowers, he worships God with mere Ganges water and the leaves of the bel-tree. His food offering to the Deity consists of sweetened puffed rice or a few candies. Occasionally he cooks a little rice pudding for the Deity.“There is also another class of devotees, those who are beyond the three gunas. They have the nature of a child. Their worship consists in chanting God’s name — just His name. (Source:Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna)",
      "—–",
      "“People of bygone generations had tremendous faith. What faith Haladhari’s father had! Once he was on the way to his daughter’s house when he noticed some beautiful flowers and vilwa-leaves. He gathered them for the worship of the Family Deity and walked back five or six miles to his own house.“Once a theatrical troupe in the village was enacting the life of Rama. When Kaikeyi asked Rama to go into exile in the forest, Haladhari’s father, who had been watching the performance, sprang up. He went to the actor who played Kaikeyi, crying out, ‘You wretch!’, and was about to burn the actor’s face with a torch. He was a very pious man. After finishing his ablutions he would stand in the water and meditate on the Deity, reciting the invocation: ‘I meditate on Thee, of red hue and four faces’, while tears streamed down his cheeks.“When my father walked along the lanes of the village wearing his wooden sandals, the shopkeepers would stand up out of respect and say, ‘There he comes!’ When he bathed in the Haldarpukur, the villagers would not have the courage to get into the water. Before bathing they would inquire if he had finished his bath.“When my father chanted the name of Raghuvir, his chest would turn crimson. This also happened to me. When I saw the cows at Vrindavan returning from the pasture, I was transported into a divine mood and my body became red.“Very strong was the faith of the people in those days. One hears that God used to dance then, taking the form of Kali, while the devotee clapped his hands keeping time.” (Source:Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna)",
      "—–",
      "“The sannyasi’s way of living is like observing the ekadasi fast without taking even a drop of water. If he clings to enjoyment, then he has reason to be afraid. ‘Woman and gold’ is enjoyment. If a monk enjoys it, he is swallowing his own spittle, as it were. There are different kinds of enjoyment: money, wealth, name, fame, and sense pleasures. It is not good for a sannyasi to sit in the company of a woman devotee, or even to talk to her. This injures him and others as well. Then others cannot learn from him; he cannot set an example to humanity. A sannyasi keeps his body in order to teach mankind.“To sit with a woman or talk to her a long time has also been described as a kind of sexual intercourse. There are eight kinds. To listen to a woman and enjoy her conversation is one kind; to speak about a woman is another kind; to whisper to her privately is a third kind; to keep something belonging to a woman and enjoy it is a fourth kind; to touch her is a fifth. Therefore a sannyasi should not salute his guru’s young wife, touching her feet. These are the rules for sannyasis.“But the case is quite different with householders. After the birth of one or two children, the husband and wife should live as brother and sister. The other seven kinds of sexual intercourse do not injure them much.“A householder has various debts: debts to the gods, to the fathers, and to the rishis. He also owes a debt to his wife. He should make her the mother of one or two children and support her if she is a chaste woman.“Householders do not know who is a good wife and who is a bad wife, who is a vidyasakti and who is an avidyasakti. A vidyasakti, a good wife, has very little lust and anger. She sleeps little. She pushes her husband’s head away from her. She is full of affection, kindness, devotion, modesty, and other noble qualities. Such a wife serves all, looking on all men as her children. Further, she helps increase her husband’s love of God. She doesn’t spend much money lest her husband should have to work hard and thus not get leisure to think of God.“Mannish women have different traits. These are bad traits: squint eyes and hollow eyes, catlike eyes, lantern jaws like a calf’s, and pigeon-breast”GIRISH:“What is the way for people like us?”MASTER:“Bhakti is the only essential thing. Bhakti has different aspects: the sattvic, the rajasic, and the tamasic.One who has sattvic bhakti is very modest and humble. But a man with tamasic bhakti is like a highwayman in his attitude toward God. He says: ‘O God, I am chanting Your name; how can I be a sinner? O God, You are my own Mother; You must reveal Yourself to me.'”GIRISH (smiling):“It is you, sir, who teach us tamasic bhakti.” (Source:Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna)",
      "One day we asked: “Does God exist? How can one see God?”",
      "The Master replied: “God really exists. You do not see stars during the day, but that does not mean that the stars do not exist. There is butter in milk, but can anyone know this by looking at milk? In order to get butter you must churn the milk in a cool place before sunrise. If you want to catch fish in a pond, you have to learn the art of fishing from those who know it, and then you must throw the line into the water and sit patiently with a fishing rod. Soon the fish will grab the bait. Then, as soon as the float sinks, you can pull the fish to shore. Similarly, you cannot realize God by merely wishing. Have faith in the instructions of a holy man. Make your mind like a fishing rod and your prana, or life force, like a hook. Your devotion and japa must be like the bait. Eventually you will be blessed by the vision of God.”",
      "Previously we had not believed in the existence of God. Furthermore, after associating with the Brahmo Samaj we had come to believe that God is formless. The Master read our minds and said: “Yes, God can be seen. Could God, whose creation is so beautiful and enchanting, be imperceptible?”",
      "We said: “Sir, whatever you say is true. Who can refute you? Is it possible to realize God in this life?”",
      "The Master replied: “You get what you desire. Faith alone is the key to success.” Then he sang a song:",
      "The Master continued: “The more you advance in one direction, the more you leave behind the opposite direction. If you move ten steps towards the east, you move ten steps away from the west.”",

      "It is to be noted that the Lord first takes up the threefold kinds of food dear to the three types of men. In spiritual sadhana, food is of great importance, because the mind is formed by the food that is taken. Pure food develops the pure mind, and the pure mind easily grasps the spiritual truth. So all the seekers should be extremely careful about their food."

      "The Sattvic nature relishes only pure and agreeable food, as described in this verse. Food has a direct bearing on the spiritual life. It is not a negligible matter as some indulgent people imagine. It should be within the experience of everyone that when impure and offensive food is taken the mind immediately reacts by generating sensual tendencies, irritability, anger etc. If men take a little more care about their food and its regulation, not only will they be more healthy and happy, but they will also gain insight into the subtler truths of the spiritual realm. Such being the importance of food, the Lord first prescribes the type of food which is dear to the Sattvic type of men.",

      "In theeighteenth Discourse 38th verse, the Lord explains that Rajasic happiness appears to be pleasing in the beginning but turns out to be extremely painful in the end. Similarly hot and sour food may be relishing to some palates, but they produce grievous discomfort, pain and disease, in the end. This is experienced by many in everyday life. Besides, Rajasic food disturbs Dhyana Sadhana. The mind becomes distracted and agitated and so it cannot remain steady in contemplation. Among the animals, lions, tigers, and wolves are restless and foul, whereas cows, goats and others of their kind are calm and non-injurious.",
      "amayapradah:Rajasic food produces disease. What can man achieve with a disease-sticken body? He has neither worldly nor spiritual welfare. So the seekers should abandon all such varieties of food and strive in every way to keep the body light, pure and strong. The choice of food is in itself a part of self-discipline and an important aspect also. We find real Sadhakas extremely fastidious about their food. They take food and water at regular intervals, and do not load the stomach at all odd times with all odd food-stuffs. Such discipline goes a long way to secure self-control easily and these men rise to higher planes of spiritual experience. That should be the standard to be followed by all earnest seekers.",
      "Question:What is the nature of Rajasic food?",

      "What the proper food is, what kind, we have to determine ourselves. Nobody can determine that [for us].

So the amount and kind of energy that we want, the food must determine. … The proper diet means, generally, simply do not eat highly spiced foods. There are three sorts of mind, says the yogi, according to the elements of nature. One is the dull mind, which covers the luminosity of the soul. Then there is that which makes people active, and lastly, that which makes them calm and peaceful. Now there are persons born with the tendency to sleep all the time. Their taste will be towards that type of food which is rotting — crawling cheese. They will eat cheese that fairly jumps off the table. It is a natural tendency with them. Then active people.

      "The Lord has already laid down the law that the Sastras are the authority about what ought to be done or what ought not to be done. Therefore it is said here that the Yajna should be ‘vidhidrishtah‘. Moreover it should be decided after deep consideration whether to perform the sacrifice or not, according to time, place and other circumstances. Above all this, it should be performed without any selfish motive. It should be an act of Nishkama karmayoga. Such Yagna is called Sattvic.Here the word ‘Yajna’ does not mean sacrifice of animals and other living beings. It refers to all charitable and beneficient acts of a divine character. Any good done in that spirit becomes a Yajna.",
      "Manah samadhaya:It is imperative that the act to be performed should be carefully considered, decided, and fixed before doing it. Otherwise, the wavering mind creates hundred doubts and fears at the time of performing it. Such actions do not bear any good fruit at all. They are sometimes half done and left incomplete. The doer gains no peace or satisfaction from such works. So one should consider the pros and cons, satisfy himself about the Sastraic laws, take the advice of the elders and well-wishers, and then only go into action. Such work is Sattvic and yields the best door to rewards to the doer and to the world. The point is that there should not be any longing to taste the fruits of work. They should be offered to the Lord. Such work is the highest and the noblest.",
      "Question:What is the nature of the Sattvic Yajna?",

      "Verses 14, 15 and 16, which deal with the restraint and discipline of the body, speech, and mind, are of the greatest importance for all seekers. They should practise the three-fold austerity, and attain perfect purity of body, speech and mind. Such purity at once leads to self-realisation.",
      "Tapas is intended to purify the body and mind through which the individual has to function and strive for Atmajnana. Unless the body is purified internally and externally, the highest knowledge cannot be experienced. The word Tapas is generally associated with severe self-denial and self-mortification. People think that Tapas is suffering in heat and cold, abstaining from food, standing on one leg or keeping hands uplifted, and such other feats of physical endurance. Such horror-producing practices are not at all mentioned by the Lord. No one needs to be terrified by the word tapas. The Lord’s interpretation is practical and within the easy reach of any seeker who is striving for Atmajnana. Men and women can practise it. So, it is the duty of all sincere aspirants to undertake the discipline mentioned here and attain the goal.",
      "The austerity of the body consists of five clear practices mentioned below:",
      "(1) Reverence towards and worship of elders, Mahatmas, and devotees. By such worship, two great rewards are reaped by the worshipper. He acquires their grace and his egoism vanishes. Spiritual development is not possible without the grace of God, Guru and Mahatmas. Maya does not easily give way for man to cross over. The obstacles cannot be cleared without their grace. So the real seeker should win their blessing by humility and reverence, by service and devotion, by worship and selfless service. Their grace is infinitely helpful for man. He becomes humble, wise, unselfish and the super-obstacle the Ego lets go its strangle-hold on the heart of man. That is why the Lord mentioned such worship as the first type of austerity for the body.",
      "Dvijah:(The twice-born) Twice-born means that man after he acquires Atmajnana takes a new birth quite distinct from the body and mind with which he was born. It is indeed a second birth, for, having attained Atma Jnana he discards the former life of the senses and the mind as alien to his true nature. Such men are twice-born. They reflect the glory and majesty, light and perfection of Paramatma. They are Divine in human form.",
      "Prajna:(One who has ‘prajna’ i.e. a Jnani) ‘Prajnanam Brahma’ that is the Upanishadic declaration. It is the essence of Brahmam, it is knowledge supreme, and the man who possesses it is prajna (knower of Brahmam). Worship of such jnanis is declared to be the austerity of the Body.",
      "(2)Saucham:Mental purity, bodily purity, and purity of the surroundings are all necessary. Impurities of the body not only produce diseases but also weaknens the mind and makes it incapable of ascent into higher spiritual regions. And to the impure even the idea of a higher life does not occur. Therefore the sadhaka should clean the surroundings, purify the body by regular bathing and good food, and clean the mind by rejecting all sensual thoughts and feelings, and by associating it with the Divine.",
      "(3)Arjavam:Everyone should cultivate harmony between thought, word and deed. This is integrity. Crookedness like the crawling reptiles is the sign of a poisonous heart filled with selfish and cruel motives. When the three functional modes of thought, word and deed are straight and harmonious, man is said to follow truth, and truth is the open gateway to Self-realisation.",
      "(4)Brahmacharyam:The Lord says that the vow of celibacy in thought, word and deed is the highest tapas. It means perfect non-attachment with the objective world, freedom from lustful thoughts, passions and acts, and meditation on the Supreme Brahmam. Celibacy is the foundation for all other Sadhanas. Therefore its importance is several times mentioned in the Gita. It is like the main-switch for the entire illumination in the spiritual realm.",
      "(5)Ahimsa:(Non-injury to any creature in thought word and deed) Ignorance of Truth is – injury to one’s own self. So man should acquire knowledge of what he really is, what this world is, and who the ruler and controller of this universe is. By this understanding, man frees himself from constant self-injury. It is needless to say that injuring other beings is strictly prohibited by the Sastras. Such harmful thoughts and acts are a negation of the basic truth of the Lord’s presence in all beings.",
      "Question:What is the austerity of the body?",
      "Answer:1. Reverence and worship of the Devas, Gurus and Brahmanishthas, 2. purity of body and mind, 3. integrity, 4. continence, 5. non-injury – these five constitute Tapas of the body."

    "commentary": [
      "Manah prasadah:The mind should be clear, calm, and light. If Tamoguna dominates, it is dull, heavy, and morose. If Rajoguna dominates, it is troubled, distracted and unbalanced. So the seeker has to cultivate Sattvaguna, and keep the mind in that calm screne state. The aim should be to prevent the disturbing elements, dark passions (impure Samskaras) from taking root in the mind. This can be achieved by unfailing devotion and clear knowledge which leads to dispassion. Serenity of mind implies internal purity. This practice consciously undertaken and kept up continuously is what is called austerity of the mind.",
      "Saumyatvam:Face is the index of the mind. The fleeting thoughts and passions of mind cast shadows in the face. Anger, hatred, lust, fear, greed all these darken and twist the countenance into worried states, most unpleasant for others to see. When the mind is serene and peaceful, the face is bright and delightful. The seekers should examine themselves how far they could keep up the cheerfulness of spirit, and produce an impression of joy and love. It should be clearly noted that a gloomy and forbidding face is not a mark of spiritual advancement. On the other hand, we find the Mahatmas beaming with joy, cheerful and humourous, radiating that indefinable joy and knowledge all around.",
      "Maunam:Silence is of two kinds – 1. restraining external sounds; 2. stillness of the inner organ (mind). Here silence of the mind is mentioned. The first is of great importance as a means to achieve the second. Of course, mere stopping the external organ is useless when the mind is distracted by hundreds of worldly thoughts. In that case, external silence comes under “Midhyachara”. The aim is to acquire perfect stillness of mind, and detachment from the objective world. Therefore the Lord speaks of Mouna as the austerity of mind and not of the body. So one should understand that internal silence is the aim and restraint of speech is a means to that end.",
      "Atmavinigrahah:Here the word ‘atma’ means the mind and senses. Restraining the mind from running after worldly pleasures is Tapas in the highest sense of the word. The word ‘vinigrahah‘ implies that the mind should be fully controlled, so that there cannot be any trace of attachment to objects. So also, ‘bhavasamsuddhi‘ implies perfect purity of thought and feeling. Not a speck of dirt should there be in the mind. Such mental purity reflects ‘Atma’ clearly, as the sun is clearly reflected in a calm lake of pure water.",
      "Question:What is the austerity of mind?",
      "Answer:Serenity, delightful countenance, stillness of mind (stilled in meditation on Paramatma) constitute austerity of mind."

All human beings, whatsoever caste, creed or race they belong to, are qualified for the highest state by austerity, self-control, and knowledge.",

In truth, whatever good we do to others, whatever sacrifice we make for the sake of others, is a good done unto one’s own self.

It is done out of sheer compassion, and such feelings soften the heart and enable men to understand the secret of oneness of all beings. Gifts offered to the rich and powerful are vitiated by the secret motive of receiving some benefit from them in due time. Hence it is not an act of spiritual merit.",

      "The Master was conversing with Mahimacharan. He asked him: “Isn’t feeding people a kind of service to God? God exists in all beings as fire. To feed people is to offer oblations to that Indwelling Spirit. But then one shouldn’t feed the wicked, I mean people who are entangled in gross worldliness or who have committed heinous crimes like adultery. Even the ground where such people sit becomes impure to a depth of seven cubits. Once Hriday fed a number of people at his native place. A good many of them were wicked. I said to Hriday: ‘Look here. If you feed such people I shall leave your house at once.’ (To Mahima) I hear that you used to feed people; but now you don’t give any such feasts. Is it because your expenses have gone up?” (Laughter.) (Source:Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna)",
      "—–",
      "M. saluted the Master and they conversed on the south verandah.MASTER:“I want to know how you meditate. When I meditated under the bel-tree I used to see various visions clearly. One day I saw in front of me money, a shawl, a tray of sandesh, and two women. I asked my mind, ‘Mind, do you want any of these?’ I saw the sandesh to be mere filth. One of the women had a big ring in her nose. I could see both their inside and outside — entrails, filth, bone, flesh, and bloods The mind did not want any of these — money, shawl, sweets, or women. It remained fixed at the Lotus Feet of God.“A small balance has two needles, the upper and the lower. The mind is the lower needle. I was always afraid lest the mind should move away from the upper needle — God. Further, I would see a man always sitting by me with a trident in his hand. He threatened to strike me with it if the lower needle, moved away from the upper one.“But no spiritual progress is possible without the renunciation of ‘woman and gold’. I renounced these three: land, wife, and wealth. Once I went to the Registry Office to register some land, the title of which was in the name of Raghuvir. The officer asked me to sign my name; but I didn’t do it, because I couldn’t feel that it was ‘my’ land. I was shown much respect as the guru of Keshab Sen. They presented me with mangoes, but I couldn’t carry them home. A sannyasi cannot lay things up.“How can one expect to attain God without renunciation? Suppose one thing is placed upon another; how can you get the second without removing the first?“One must pray to God without any selfish desire. But selfish worship, if practised with perseverance, is gradually turned into selfless worship. Dhruva practised tapasya to obtain his kingdom, but at last he realised God. He said, ‘Why should a man give up gold if he gets it while searching for glass beads?’",
      "“God can be realised when a man acquires sattva. Householders engage in philanthropic work, such as charity, mostly with a motive. That is not good. But actions without motives are good. Yet it is very difficult to leave motives out of one’s actions.“When you realise God, will you pray to Him, ‘O God, please grant that I may dig reservoirs, build roads, and found hospitals and dispensaries’? After the realisation of God all such desires are left behind.“Then mustn’t one perform acts of compassion, such as charity to the poor? I do not forbid it. If a man has money, he should give it to remove the sorrows and sufferings that come to his notice. In such an event the wise man says, ‘Give the poor something.’ But inwardly he feels: ‘What can I do? God alone is the Doer. I am nothing.’“The great souls, deeply affected by the sufferings of men, show them the way to God. Sankaracharya kept the ‘ego of Knowledge’ in order to teach mankind. The gift of knowledge and devotion is far superior to the gift of food. Therefore Chaitanyadeva distributed bhakti to all, including the out-caste. Happiness and suffering are the inevitable characteristics of the body. You have come to eat mangoes. Fulfil that desire. The one thing needful is jnana and bhakti. God alone is Substance; all else is illusory. (Source:Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna)",
      "AlthoughShambhuwas generous, he was also careful about his charity. The Master’s nephew Hriday one day asked Shambhu for some money. Shambhu told him: “Why should I give you money? You can earn your livelihood by working. Even now you are earning something. The case of a very poor person is different. The purpose of charity is fulfilled if one gives money to the blind or the lame.” Hriday then said: “Sir, please don’t say that. I don’t need your money. May God help me not to become blind or deaf or extremely poor! I don’t want you to give, and I don’t want to receive.” (Source: They Lived with God)",

      "Another interpretation for Om Tat Sat – Om: Para Brahman; Tat: That (Brahman alone); Sat: is (reality) Everything else in the entire objective universe is only a shadow unreal (Mithya).",
      "Therefore the MantraOm Tat Satimplies the very highest truth of all the Vedas and the Sastras – Brahma satyam jagan mithya (Brahman is real, the universe is unreal). Thus the aspirants should utter this unique Mantra, contemplate the reality of Brahman, reject the unreal world, and develop dispassion and knowledge. They should firmly establish themselves in Brahman, the only reality.",
      "Two meanings could be given to Om Tat Sat as follows:",

      "The importance of the first syllable ‘Om’ is declared here. Knowing the sacredness and power of this single syllable Om as the name of Brahman, the sages begin every Karma, only after uttering it. And at the end of every Karma also the syllable Om is uttered. Thus, both at the beginning and at the end of every work, the Parama Mantra is repeated by the knowers of the Vedas. Whatever defects there may be in the work done, by negligence or ignorance, all these are burnt up by the utterance of Pranava, and the little that is done, yields the highest reward.",
      "Satatam:The utterance of Om is invariably practised by the learned, because they know that Brahman as designated by the symbol Om, is the Intelligence power that gives truth and substance to all acts of sacrifice, charity austerity etc. Just as the engine by its power draws all the coaches attached to it, just as the number one gives value to all the zeroes that come after it, even so Om (Brahman) gives life and light to every sacred act performed by man.",
      "Question:What is the power of Om?",
      "Answer:The knowers of the Vedas always begin every sacred act by the utterance of OM the Pranava symbol of Brahman."

      "It is declared here that the seekers of liberation, perform acts of sacrifice, charity and austerity, without seeking for their fruit. Thus performed without any longing for personal rewards, these acts purify the mind and pave the way for Moksha. The renunciation of the fruits of actions is one of the main tenets of the Gita, and it is absolutely the pre-condition for Self realisation.",
      "Moreover, we understand that the aspirants of Moksha should perform all these acts of sacrifice, and charity, while remaining unconcerned about their fruit. These acts are not to be abandoned, because they are helpful to purify the mind, and to reach the goal of liberation. The Lord insists on action as the purifying agent indispensable for spiritual realisation. The same idea is repeated in the next discourse also",
      "Some are of the view that no good acts should be done because even good acts bind man. The teacher of the Gita does not subscribe to this view. On the other hand, He emphasises that good acts should not be abandoned; they should be performed. Therefore, the seekers of liberation should undertake all good actions like sacrifice, charity, austarity etc., purify themselves, and attain Brahmajnana.",

    "commentary": [
      "The Lord affirms the performance of sacrifice, austerity and charity, again and again. Steadfastness in performing these acts itself is the Brahman, designated by the word ‘Sat’. Thus we can imagine the holiness of these acts. They are ‘Sat’. Moreover, all auspicious acts done for the sake of the Supreme are also named ‘Sat’. All such acts of inner purification, lead to the same goal-Brahman. In this manner, Brahman whose form is existence (isness) (Sat) is to be realised by these acts which are also called ‘Sat’. The condition to be carefully noted is that these acts should be performed for the sake of that Brahman, renouncing the fruits to God, and with no motive of personal gain. Then only they are ‘Sat’ and lead to Tat (That). Otherwise, the plane of action does not change. They are just like the hundred and one other actions that are usually done for personal profit and bind them to the wheel of Samsara.Action in itself cannot bind. It binds when one is attached to its fruits and desire to enjoy worldly benefits through them.Then they are not ‘Sať’, because they are practised for the sake of the world (Asat) and not for the sake of Brahman (Sat). The Lord teaches the Divinity of action in this verse. Knowing this, the seekers of truth should perform the best forms of action like Yajna, Tapas and Dana, with the ultimate aim of realising Brahman and attaining perfection and freedom.",
      "Question:What is the significance of Sat?",
      "Answer:Steadfastness in the performance of Yajna, Tapas and Dana, is Sat. All acts performed for the sake of Brahman are Sat. Thus the sages transform every good act into Sat, by renunciation of the fruit of action."

    "commentary": [
      "Faith (sraddha) is the Key-note of success either in worldly life or in spiritual life. Without it, nothing is achieved even in small matters concerning everyday life. In spiritual life where man tries to ascend to the highest state the need for unswerving faith is greatly emphasised. That is why the Lord insists on faith in many places and He has devoted a whole Discourse to elaborate on the theme of faith (sraddha). Whatever may be the act performed by either Yajna or Dana or Tapas, or other good works, If there is no faith in the heart of the doer, it becomes utterly useless. It does not acquire the status of ‘Sat’. It is just ‘Asat’ (i.e.) something equal to zero, something not performed at all. Such acts bring no good either here or hereafter. A person may gather all materials for preparing food, and yet, if the cook has no ‘sraddha‘ in what he is doing, the whole thing goes to waste. So also, in the spiritual field, whatever other qualities the aspirants may possess, if he is void of faith, his austerities, sacrifices and charities bear no fruit at all. It remains only in the realm of the ‘Asat’ and cannot be transformed into ‘Sat’. Therefore it is the duty of all seekers to do their ‘sadhana’ with faith and realise the goal. Even a little of such ‘sadhana’ with faith will help to realise the Self. And such ‘sadhana’ does not at all go in vain. Thus, holding on to faith as the support, propelling force, and guiding light, man has to march forward towards the ultimate reality, the supreme Brahman.",
      "One day the Holy Mother invited Amzad for lunch and served him on the porch of her house. Owing to caste prejudices, Nalini, the Mother’s niece, threw the food at Amzad’s leaf plate from a distance. Holy Mother noticed this and said: “How can one enjoy food when it is served with such scorn? Let me wait on him properly.” After Amzad had finished his meal, Holy Mother cleaned the place where he had sat with her own hands. Nalini shrieked: “Aunt, you have lost your caste!”",
      "“Keep quiet,” the Mother scolded her. Then she added: “As Sharat is my son, exactly so is Amzad.” Sharat was a direct disciple of Ramakrishna, the secretary of the Ramakrishna Mission, and a monk endowed with saintly virtues; Amzad was a Muslim and a convicted robber. Thus Holy Mother demonstrated that she is the Mother of the good and the bad. She also showed that kind treatment can enkindle faith in the heart of a weak, lowly man and prove to him that he is a son of the Divine Mother. Her example brought to life the words of Krishna: “I am the same towards all beings; to Me there is none hateful or dear. But those who worship Me with devotion—they are in Me, and I too am in them.”",
      "One morning in Jayrambati while the Mother was rubbing her body with oil, someone was sweeping the courtyard. After the work was done, that person threw the broomstick aside. At this the Mother said: “What is this? You have thrown away the broomstick with such disrespect when the work is done. It takes the same amount of time to put it gently in a corner as it does to throw it aside. One should not trifle with a thing though it may be very insignificant. If you respect a thing, the thing also respects you. Will you not again need that broomstick? Besides, it is also a part of this family. From that standpoint also, it deserves to be treated with respect. Even a broomstick should be treated with respect. One should perform even an insignificant task with respect.”",
      "Question:What will be the effect of Yajna, Dana, and Tapas, if they are performed without faith?",

      "Answer:No, Neither here nor hereafter do they bring any good.",
      "Question:What then is man’s duty?",
      "Answer:Everyone should carry on his Sadhana with redoubled confidence and faith, and reach the goal quickly."
